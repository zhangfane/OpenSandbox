/**
 * Egress policy operations routed through the lifecycle control plane.
 *
 * Implements the Egress protocol against the lifecycle server
 * (`/sandboxes/{sandboxId}/networkpolicy`) instead of the sandbox-side
 * egress sidecar. Used for sandboxes created from fsb templates, where the
 * policy intent is persisted server-side.
 *
 * The lifecycle server exposes the same merge/delete rule semantics as the
 * sidecar policy API (PATCH merges with first-wins-per-target; DELETE
 * removes by target idempotently), so no client-side read-modify-write is
 * needed.
