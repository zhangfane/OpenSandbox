     Lists entries under a directory with optional depth control. By default,

    value to include descendants up to that many levels below `path`. The
    root directory itself is not included in the response.

    Symbolic links are reported with `type=symlink` and are not traversed:
    the listing never descends into a link target, even when `depth` would

    a symbolic link the request is rejected with `400`; callers must pass
    the real directory path they want listed.

    Entries are returned in lexical order by entry name within each

    the same lexical order, so a depth-2 listing yields stable, predictable
    output for file-browser style clients.
