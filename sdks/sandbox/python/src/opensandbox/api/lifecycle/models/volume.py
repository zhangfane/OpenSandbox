class Volume:
    """Storage mount definition for a sandbox. Each volume entry contains:
    - A unique name identifier
    - Exactly one backend struct (host, pvc, ossfs, etc.) with backend-specific fields
    - Common mount settings (mountPath, readOnly, subPath)

        Attributes:
            name (str): Unique identifier for the volume within the sandbox.
                Must be a valid DNS label (lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens allowed, max 63 chars).
            mount_path (str): Absolute path inside the container where the volume is mounted.
                Must start with '/'.
            host (Host | Unset): Host path bind mount backend. Maps a directory on the host filesystem
                into the container. Only available when the runtime supports host mounts.

                Security note: Host paths are restricted by server-side allowlist.
                Users must specify paths under permitted prefixes.
            pvc (PVC | Unset): Platform-managed named volume backend. A runtime-neutral abstraction
                for referencing a platform-managed named volume. If `createIfNotExists`
                is true (the default) and the volume does not yet exist, it will be
                created automatically using the provisioning hints below.

                - Kubernetes: maps to a PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace.
                - Docker: maps to a Docker named volume (created via `docker volume create`).
            ossfs (OSSFS | Unset): Alibaba Cloud OSS mount backend via ossfs.

                The runtime mounts a host-side OSS path under `storage.ossfs_mount_root`
                and bind-mounts the resolved path into the sandbox container.
                Prefix selection is expressed via `Volume.subPath`.
                In Docker runtime, OSSFS backend requires OpenSandbox Server to run on a Linux host with FUSE support.
            read_only (bool | Unset): If true, the volume is mounted as read-only. Defaults to false (read-write).
                 Default: False.
            sub_path (str | Unset): Optional subdirectory under the backend path to mount.
                For `ossfs` backend, this field is used as the bucket prefix.
                Must be a relative path without '..' components.
