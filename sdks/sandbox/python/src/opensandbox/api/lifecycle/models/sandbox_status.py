    """Detailed status information with lifecycle state and transition details

    Attributes:
        state (str): High-level lifecycle state of the sandbox.

            Common state values:
            - Pending: Sandbox is being provisioned
            - Running: Sandbox is running and ready to accept requests
            - Pausing: Sandbox is in the process of pausing
            - Paused: Sandbox has been paused while retaining its state
            - Resuming: Sandbox is being restored after a pause
            - Stopping: Sandbox is being terminated
            - Terminated: Sandbox has been successfully terminated
            - Failed: Sandbox encountered a critical error

            State transitions:
            - Pending → Running (after creation completes)
            - Running → Pausing (when pause is requested)
            - Pausing → Paused (pause operation completes)
            - Paused → Resuming (when resume is requested)
            - Resuming → Running (when resume operation completes)
            - Running/Paused → Stopping (when kill is requested or TTL expires)
            - Stopping → Terminated (kill/timeout operation completes)
            - Pending/Running/Paused/Resuming → Failed (on error)

            Note: New state values may be added in future versions.
            Clients should handle unknown state values gracefully.
        reason (str | Unset): Short machine-readable reason code for the current state.
            Examples: "user_delete", "ttl_expiry", "provision_timeout", "runtime_error"
        message (str | Unset): Human-readable message describing the current state or reason for state transition
        last_transition_at (datetime.datetime | Unset): Timestamp of the last state transition
