class PlatformSpec:
    """Runtime platform constraint used for scheduling/provisioning.

    This field is independent from `image` and expresses the expected target
    OS and CPU architecture for sandbox execution.

    Behavioral notes:
    - If omitted, the runtime applies its own default platform selection behavior.
      For Docker, requests are created without an explicit platform override.
      For Kubernetes, no `kubernetes.io/os` or `kubernetes.io/arch` constraint
      is injected unless provided by request or workload template.
    - If provided and cannot be satisfied by runtime/template/pool constraints,
      request must fail explicitly.

        Attributes:
            os (PlatformSpecOs): Target operating system (for example `linux` or `windows`). Example: linux.
            arch (PlatformSpecArch): Target CPU architecture (for example `amd64` or `arm64`). Example: arm64.
