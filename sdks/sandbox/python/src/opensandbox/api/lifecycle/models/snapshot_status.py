    """Detailed snapshot status information with lifecycle state and transition details.

    Attributes:
        state (str): Snapshot lifecycle state.

            Common state values:
            - Creating: Snapshot creation has been accepted and runtime capture is in progress.
            - Deleting: Snapshot deletion has been requested and cleanup is in progress.
            - Ready: Snapshot is available for restoring sandboxes.
            - Failed: Snapshot creation failed.

            Note: New state values may be added in future versions.
            Clients should handle unknown state values gracefully.
        reason (str | Unset): Short machine-readable reason code for the current state.
            Examples: "snapshot_accepted", "snapshot_ready", "snapshot_capture_failed"
        message (str | Unset): Human-readable message describing the current state or failure reason
        last_transition_at (datetime.datetime | Unset): Timestamp of the last state transition
