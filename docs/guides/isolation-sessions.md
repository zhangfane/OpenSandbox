description: Per-execution bubblewrap-isolated bash sessions inside a sandbox for fast, contained code runs.

# Isolation Sessions

Isolation sessions run a **long-lived `bash` inside a
[bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) namespace**, so one
sandbox pod can host many mutually isolated task runs without spinning up a
new container. Each session gets its own PID, mount, tmpfs, and env
namespaces; startup is sub-millisecond.

## Requirements

Component versions needed for the features covered by this guide:

- `execd` >= 1.0.20 for base isolation session support; **>= 1.0.21
  recommended** for `binds`, `List sessions`, `uid_mode: "userns"`, and the
  default writable allowlist (`/workspace`, `/mnt`, `/media`, `/data`)
- `opensandbox-server` >= 0.2.1 — the server injects `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`,
  `apparmor=unconfined`, and the tmpfs mount required by `bwrap` when the
  execd image declares `bootstrap.execd.isolation`
- Python SDK >= 0.1.14 (`isolation.run_once` / `isolation.session` context
  manager); >= 0.1.13 for the generated isolation client only
- JavaScript / TypeScript SDK >= 0.1.10 (`isolation.runOnce` /
  `isolation.withSession`)
- Kotlin / Java SDK >= 1.0.16 (`isolation.runOnce()` /
  `isolation.withSession { ... }`); >= 1.0.15 for the generated isolation
  client only
- C# SDK >= 0.1.4 (`RunOnceAsync` / `WithSessionAsync`)
- Go SDK >= 1.0.4 (`IsolationRunOnce` / `IsolationWithSession`)

The `setpriv_available` / `userns_available` fields on
[`/capabilities`](#capabilities-and-probing) were added after execd v1.0.21
and are only present on execd builds from `main` at the time of writing;
older execd omits both fields (clients must tolerate their absence).

Host requirements (`bwrap` binary, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, `overlayfs`, etc.) are
listed under [Server Configuration → Host Requirements](#server-configuration).

The published execd image includes the fail-closed native workload gate used
during session startup. For a Linux source build, `make build` requires a C
compiler plus static libc and produces `bin/opensandbox-session-gate`; run
`make build-session-gate` and then `sudo make install-session-gate` before
starting execd to install the helper at
`/opt/opensandbox/opensandbox-session-gate`. Keep that path and its parent
directory root-owned and not group- or world-writable.

---

## Overview

| Concept | Boundary | Startup | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Isolation session** | bubblewrap namespaces inside one sandbox | ~100 ms to create; subsequent `run` in an existing session is near-zero overhead | Many short, mutually isolated task runs reusing one long-lived session |
| Bash session (`/session`) | bash process, no extra namespaces | ms | Interactive REPL-style command sequences |
| Sandbox | container or pod | 100s of ms to seconds | Tenant, workspace, or user boundary |
| Secure runtime (gVisor / Kata) | user-space kernel or VM per sandbox | 10–500 ms | Hardware-level protection against container escape |

::: info Session creation vs. per-run cost
Creating a session takes about 100 ms because execd waits briefly after
starting `bwrap` to detect an immediately-exiting child. Once the session
exists, each `POST /run` reuses the same bash process, so per-run overhead
is negligible. Design workloads that amortize the create cost across many
`run` calls in one session.
:::

Good fits: **RL rollouts**, **batch code grading**, **multi-tool agent
runs** — one sandbox per worker, many isolated tasks inside.

Not a fit: cross-language kernels (use `/code`), interactive REPLs (use
`/session`), or hard trust boundaries against kernel exploits (use gVisor /
Kata; see [Secure Container Runtime](/guides/secure-container)).

---

## How It Works

`execd` forks one `bwrap` child per session; `bwrap` sets up Linux
namespaces, then `exec`s a long-lived `bash` inside them.

![Isolation session runtime layout](../public/images/isolation-sessions-layout.svg)

Two things the diagram doesn't show:

- `bash` is long-lived, so `export X=1` in one `run` is visible to the next
  `run` **in the same session** (never in another session).
- The FS proxy reads and writes the merged workspace view from **outside**
  the namespace, so uploads and downloads work while `bash` is busy.

### `run` request flow

![Isolation session run flow](../public/images/isolation-sessions-run-flow.svg)

Non-happy paths:

| Event | What happens |
|---|---|
| Run `timeout_seconds` elapsed | execd cancels the run context, which sends `SIGINT` to the bwrap process group and emits an `IsolatedError` SSE event; the session itself stays alive. |
| `bwrap` process exited | The next `run` returns an `IsolatedError` SSE event with `session process has exited`; only `ErrContextNotFound` (session ID unknown) becomes an HTTP-level error. `DELETE` + recreate. |
| Idle timeout reached | GC runs the same teardown as `DELETE`. |
| Client disconnects mid-SSE | The Gin request context is cancelled and execd sends `SIGINT` to the running command; the run does **not** continue in the background. |

## Quick Start

### curl

```bash
# Probe.
curl -s http://localhost:44772/v1/isolated/capabilities

# Create.
SESSION=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:44772/v1/isolated/session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "profile": "strict",
    "workspace": {"path": "/workspace", "mode": "overlay"},
    "idle_timeout_seconds": 300
  }' | jq -r .session_id)

# Run (SSE: stdout / error / complete).
curl -N -X POST "http://localhost:44772/v1/isolated/session/$SESSION/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code": "export X=1; echo $X", "timeout_seconds": 30}'

# Second run reuses shell state.
curl -N -X POST "http://localhost:44772/v1/isolated/session/$SESSION/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code": "echo $X"}'  # prints 1

# Delete.
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:44772/v1/isolated/session/$SESSION"
```

### Python SDK

```python
from opensandbox import Sandbox
from opensandbox.models.isolated import (
    CreateIsolatedSessionRequest, IsolatedWorkspaceSpec, IsolatedRunOpts,
)

# Sandbox.create is an async classmethod, so await it before entering
# the async context manager.
async with (await Sandbox.create("python:3.11")) as sandbox:
    # One-shot.
    await sandbox.isolation.run_once(
        "python -c 'print(42)'", workspace="/workspace", profile="strict",
    )

    # Persistent session.
    async with sandbox.isolation.session(
        CreateIsolatedSessionRequest(
            workspace=IsolatedWorkspaceSpec(path="/workspace", mode="overlay"),
            profile="strict",
            idle_timeout_seconds=300,
        )
    ) as session:
        await session.run("export STAGE=train")
        await session.run("python train.py", opts=IsolatedRunOpts(timeout_seconds=600))
        await session.files.write_file("/workspace/data.csv", data_bytes)

    # Reattach after a client restart.
    handle = await sandbox.isolation.attach(known_session_id)
```

### JavaScript / TypeScript SDK

```ts
await sandbox.isolation.runOnce("node -e 'console.log(1)'", "/workspace", {
  profile: "strict",
});

await sandbox.isolation.withSession(
  { profile: "strict", workspace: { path: "/workspace", mode: "overlay" } },
  async (session) => { await session.run("npm test"); },
);
```

### Kotlin SDK

```kotlin
sandbox.isolation().runOnce(code = "python -c 'print(1)'", workspace = "/workspace")

sandbox.isolation().withSession(request) { session ->
    session.run("ls /workspace")
}
```

## Session Lifecycle

Under `/v1/isolated/` on execd. Use `X-EXECD-ACCESS-TOKEN` when execd has
an access token configured.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/session` | Create; returns `{session_id, created_at}`. |
| `GET` | `/sessions` | List active sessions. |
| `GET` | `/session/{id}` | Full state; echoes creation params so a stateless client can rebuild the handle. |
| `POST` | `/session/{id}/run` | Foreground (default): SSE stream `stdout` / `error` / `complete`. Background (`"background": true`): returns `202` with a run handle. Runs on the same session are serialized. |
| `GET` | `/session/{id}/runs/{runId}` | Background run status: `running`, `exit_code`, `error`, timestamps. |
| `GET` | `/session/{id}/runs/{runId}/logs` | Background run combined output as plain text, with byte-cursor pagination. |
| `DELETE` | `/session/{id}` | Destroy. |
| `GET` | `/capabilities` | Probe. |

`idle_timeout_seconds > 0` destroys idle sessions automatically; set to `0`
to disable idle GC and always `DELETE` explicitly.

---

## Background Runs

A background run starts code detached inside the session and returns
immediately; the run's combined stdout/stderr and exit code are captured by
execd, and the client polls them while other work continues on the session.

```bash
# Start detached; 202 returns {"session_id", "run_id", "started_at"}.
RUN=$(curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:44772/v1/isolated/session/$SESSION/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code": "sleep 5 && echo done", "background": true}' | jq -r .run_id)

# Poll status until running=false.
curl -s "http://localhost:44772/v1/isolated/session/$SESSION/runs/$RUN"

# Read output (plain text). The response header EXECD-ISOLATED-TAIL-CURSOR
# carries the next byte offset for incremental reads.
curl -s "http://localhost:44772/v1/isolated/session/$SESSION/runs/$RUN/logs"
curl -s "http://localhost:44772/v1/isolated/session/$SESSION/runs/$RUN/logs?cursor=123"
```

Python SDK:

```python
session = await sandbox.isolation.create(CreateIsolatedSessionRequest(
    workspace=IsolatedWorkspaceSpec(path="/workspace", mode="rw"),
))

run = await session.run_background("sleep 5 && echo done")
while (status := await session.run_status(run.run_id)).running:
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
print(status.exit_code)
logs = await session.run_logs(run.run_id)   # .text + .cursor for pagination
```

Background run semantics:

- `timeout_seconds` is foreground-only; background runs are not time-limited.
- Idle GC is suspended while a background run is active; after it finishes,
  the normal idle window applies. Deleting the session kills the run.
- Background runs require a writable log location, so sessions with a
  read-only (`ro`) workspace reject them with `400`; `rw` and `overlay`
  workspaces are supported.
- Runs share the session's process group, so session-level signals (e.g. the
  `SIGINT` sent when a foreground run times out or is cancelled) also reach
  them.
- Each `logs` request returns at most 16 MiB; page through large output with
  the returned cursor. Per-run log retention is capped at 16 MiB — output
  beyond the cap is discarded when the run completes, so drain incrementally
  while the run is active if you need more than the first page.
- A run whose session dies mid-flight reports `running: false` with
  `error: "session terminated"`; run records and their logs are removed when
  the session is deleted or garbage-collected.

---

## Workspace Modes

| Mode | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `rw` | Bind-mount read-write; writes persist on the host. |
| `overlay` (default) | Copy-on-write via overlayfs; writes go to a per-session upper dir and vanish on `DELETE`. |
| `ro` | Bind-mount read-only; writes fail with `EROFS`. |

Overlay upper dirs live under `upper_root` (default `/var/lib/execd/isolation`).

Because isolated-session state lives only in execd's memory, every upper dir
left under `upper_root` when execd exits is orphaned. On startup execd
reclaims leftover session directories under `upper_root` — session state never
survives a restart, so nothing legitimate is lost. Only directories with the
execd session layout (`<id>/upper`) are removed; if `upper_root` points at a
directory shared with other data, unrelated children are never touched
(`upper_root` should still be a dedicated directory). Residue that cannot be
removed yet — e.g. an upper still referenced by a mount from the previous
lifetime — stays counted toward `upper_max_bytes` and is retried by the idle
collector. In pooled / pre-provisioned sandboxes this also prevents one
occupant's session data from leaking to the next.

```json
{ "workspace": { "path": "/workspace", "mode": "overlay" } }
```

---

## Bind Mounts and Allowlist

- **`extra_writable`** — paths bind-mounted read-write at the same path
  (`source == destination`).
- **`binds`** — explicit `source` → `dest` mappings, optionally `readonly`.
  `source` must already exist; `dest` must already exist inside the
  namespace (bake it into the sandbox image).

```json
{
  "workspace": { "path": "/workspace", "mode": "rw" },
  "extra_writable": ["/data/scratch"],
  "binds": [
    { "source": "/data/in",  "dest": "/mnt/in",  "readonly": true },
    { "source": "/data/out", "dest": "/mnt/out" }
  ]
}
```

Every `source` is checked against the operator-configured `allowed_writable`
allowlist **after** symlink resolution, so symlinks cannot escape it. Default
allowlist: `/workspace`, `/mnt`, `/media`, `/data` (subpaths allowed). Empty
allowlist rejects all extra binds.

---

## Profiles and Defaults

The `profile` field currently controls only how `/tmp` is exposed inside the
namespace:

| Profile | `/tmp` |
|---|---|
| `strict` (default) | Private tmpfs (`--tmpfs /tmp`) |
| `balanced` | Shared with the sandbox (`--bind /tmp /tmp`) |

`workspace.mode` and `env_passthrough` are **independent** of the profile:
when they are omitted, execd normalizes `workspace.mode` to `overlay` and
`env_passthrough.mode` to `deny` regardless of which profile you pick. Set
those fields explicitly if you want persistent workspace writes (`"rw"`) or
host env passthrough (`"allow"`).

---

## Environment, UID, and Networking

- **`env_passthrough`** — `mode: "allow"` + `keys` whitelists host env vars;
  default `deny`. Per-run overrides go in `IsolatedRunRequest.envs`.
- **`uid` / `gid`** with **`uid_mode: "setpriv"`** (default, real
  setuid/setgid drop) or **`"userns"`** (user namespace remap). Check
  `setpriv_available` / `userns_available` from
  [`/capabilities`](#capabilities-and-probing) before requesting a mode.
- **`share_net: true`** shares the sandbox's network namespace. Sandbox-level
  egress and Credential Vault policies still apply.
- **`share_net: false`** creates a private network namespace. Before releasing
  the workload startup gate, execd opens the authenticated NetNS, obtains its
  real owning UserNS with `NS_GET_USERNS`, and bind-pins both below
  `/run/execd/namespaces/<opaque-id>/`. Any validation or pin failure aborts
  Session creation. Execd attempts pin cleanup on failed startup, process exit,
  explicit delete, idle collection, and runner shutdown; retryable failures
  retain Session ownership and are retried while execd remains alive. This
  applies to both UID modes; hardened network backends will require
  `uid_mode: "userns"`.

The legacy default remains unchanged in this phase: omitting `share_net`
continues to share the sandbox network namespace. Namespace pinning alone does
not enable Session egress or ingress.

Private Sessions are not recoverable across an execd restart. Deployments that
enable them must treat execd as sandbox-critical and recreate the entire
sandbox/container if execd exits; they must not launch a replacement execd
inside the surviving mount namespace. Destroying the sandbox/container tears
down that mount namespace and releases all pins. Execd intentionally does not
scan and adopt opaque namespace-pin directories on startup because they do not
carry a durable sandbox generation, so doing so could unmount another live
process's resources.

---

## Filesystem Proxy

Reads and writes the session's **merged** workspace view from outside the
namespace — this is how SDKs `upload`, `download`, and `list` without
spawning a shell. All paths are per session under
`/v1/isolated/session/{id}/`:

| Method | Path |
|---|---|
| `GET` | `files/info?path=...` |
| `GET` | `files/download?path=...` (supports `Range` and `offset`/`limit`) |
| `POST` | `files/upload` (multipart: `metadata` + `file`) |
| `DELETE` | `files?path=...` |
| `POST` | `files/mv` |
| `POST` | `files/permissions` |
| `POST` | `files/replace?verbose=true` |
| `GET` | `files/search?path=...&pattern=...` |
| `GET` | `directories/list?path=...&depth=N` |
| `POST` | `directories` |
| `DELETE` | `directories?path=...` |

Writes on a `ro` workspace fail; writes on `overlay` land in the upper dir
and vanish on `DELETE`.

---

## Capabilities and Probing

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:44772/v1/isolated/capabilities
```

```json
{
  "available": true,
  "isolator": "bwrap",
  "version": "0.9.0",
  "setpriv_available": true,
  "userns_available": false,
  "commit_supported": false,
  "diff_supported": false
}
```

- `available: false` — the trusted native workload gate is missing or
  untrusted, bubblewrap is missing, or the host can't create the required
  namespaces (missing `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, restricted user-ns sysctl, etc.).
- `setpriv_available` / `userns_available` — whether sessions with
  `uid_mode: "setpriv"` or `"userns"` can be created. `setpriv_available`
  reflects only execd's **default** UID/GID; a session that requests a
  different UID/GID may still return `503 NOT_SUPPORTED` when identity
  switching is unavailable.
- `commit_supported` / `diff_supported` — Phase 2 stubs, currently return `503`.

---

## Server Configuration

Point execd at an optional TOML file:

| Flag | Env |
|---|---|
| `--isolation-config` | `EXECD_ISOLATION_CONFIG` |

```toml
# Parent directory for per-session overlay upper dirs.
upper_root = "/var/lib/execd/isolation"

# Allocation-time threshold for total overlay upper-directory size (bytes).
# Existing sessions can write beyond this value.
# Default: 8 GiB. Set to 0 to disable the allocation check.
upper_max_bytes = 8589934592  # 8 GiB

# Sources allowed for extra_writable / binds (symlink-resolved).
# Default: ["/workspace", "/mnt", "/media", "/data"]. Empty = reject all.
allowed_writable = ["/workspace", "/mnt", "/media", "/data"]
```

Example: `components/execd/configs/isolation.example.toml`.

`upper_max_bytes` is checked when creating an `overlay` workspace (the default
mode). If a successful usage scan reports a total at or above the configured
positive limit, the new session is rejected. This setting does not cap writes
by existing sessions and does not apply to `rw` or `ro` workspaces.

Deleting an overlay session can restore admission once its cleanup succeeds
and total usage falls below the threshold. Deletion discards that session's
private upper data, so preserve any data you need before deleting it.

**Host requirements:** `bwrap` and the trusted native workload gate in the
execd image; `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` (and `kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1` for
`uid_mode: "userns"`); `overlayfs` in the kernel for `overlay` workspaces.
The published image installs the gate automatically. Linux source builds must
run `make build-session-gate` and then `sudo make install-session-gate` from
`components/execd` before starting execd.

Note: `/capabilities` reports `available: false` when the native workload gate
cannot be opened as a trusted executable or when bwrap itself cannot be
started (missing binary or missing namespace capabilities). A missing
`overlayfs` does **not** flip `available` — the overlay probe only influences
Phase 2 `commit`/`diff` support, and default overlay-mode session creation can
still fail at runtime on such hosts. If you rely on `workspace.mode:
"overlay"`, verify `overlayfs` support directly on the host.

---

## Limitations

- **`diff` / `commit` are Phase 2 stubs**, currently return `503`. Tracked
  in [OSEP-0013](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/blob/main/oseps/0013-isolated-execution-api.md).
- **No hardware-level guarantee.** Namespaces + seccomp only; pair with a
  secure runtime for kernel-exploit defense.
- **Linux only.** Non-Linux builds return `available: false`.
- **Serialized runs per session** — create multiple sessions for parallelism.
- **Bind destinations must pre-exist** in the sandbox image.
