# Pause and Resume Guide

This guide explains how to use the pause and resume features for Kubernetes-backed sandboxes in OpenSandbox. Pause commits the sandbox's root filesystem as an OCI image and releases cluster resources. Resume restores the sandbox from that image.

## Overview

### What Pause and Resume Does

| | Behavior |
|--|---------|
| **Pause** | Creates an internal `SandboxSnapshot`, commits the running container root filesystem as an OCI image, then quiesces the sandbox runtime and releases Pods / pooled allocations |
| **Resume** | Reuses the same `BatchSandbox`, rewrites its template to the latest snapshot image, and recreates the runtime from that image |
| **sandboxId** | Stable across pause/resume cycles — callers use the same ID throughout the sandbox lifetime |
| **Replica support** | Currently limited to `BatchSandbox.spec.replicas=1`. Server-created Kubernetes sandboxes use `replicas: 1`; direct CRs with another replica count are rejected by the controller pause entry. |

### Key Design Principle

**Controller-level configuration**: Registry URL and push/pull secrets are configured on the Kubernetes controller manager, not in `~/.sandbox.toml`. SDK users and API callers require **no code changes** to use pause/resume — they just call `pause` and `resume` on the existing sandbox ID.

### Lifecycle

```text
Time ---------------------------------------------------------------->

Sandbox lifecycle:   [Running]--[Pausing]--[Paused]--[Resuming]--[Running]
                         |                     |
                  commit rootfs          rewrite template images
                  push to registry       recreate runtime from snapshot
                  release pods/alloc
```

### State Machine Details

The sandbox transitions through both stable and intermediate states:

| State | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `Running` | Stable | Sandbox is active and processing requests |
| `Pausing` | Intermediate | Pause operation in progress. Snapshot commit is coordinated through an internal `SandboxSnapshot` resource. |
| `Paused` | Stable | Sandbox is paused, the latest rootfs snapshot is ready, and runtime Pods / pooled allocations have been released |
| `Resuming` | Intermediate | Resume operation in progress. The controller is rewriting the sandbox template to the latest snapshot image and recreating the runtime |
| `Failed` | Stable | Operation failed (check `reason` and `message` for details) |

The Lifecycle API exposes only the coarse-grained sandbox states above. For detailed snapshot progress, inspect the internal `SandboxSnapshot` resource:

Pod termination can continue after the controller reports `Paused`. A resume request
can be submitted during this interval; the controller waits for the old Pod to be
removed before recreating its replacement. Pods with a deletion timestamp do not
contribute new runtime failure conditions, including terminal exit statuses reported
by Kubernetes during deletion. Failures already recorded on the sandbox remain
terminal, and failures of replacement Pods are still reported normally.

- `Pending`: snapshot request accepted, waiting to resolve source Pod / create commit Job
- `Committing`: commit Job is running and pushing snapshot images
- `Succeed`: snapshot is ready and can be used for the next resume
- `Failed`: snapshot creation failed

### What Is Preserved

| | Preserved? |
|--|-----------|
| Root filesystem contents | ✅ Yes — committed as OCI image |
| Environment variables | ✅ Yes — from BatchSandbox template |
| Running processes / memory | Rootfs mode: no. Opt-in QEMU-in-runc mode: the QEMU process and Guest memory are restored; other outer processes restart. See [QEMU VMState Snapshots](/kubernetes/qemu-vmstate-snapshots). |
| Explicit volume mounts | Depends on volume type |
| Credential Vault entries | No - stored only in egress sidecar memory; re-inject from a trusted control plane after resume |

Pause/resume is currently single-replica only. The internal pause snapshot records one source Pod's container images and does not store per-replica state, so the Kubernetes controller rejects pause requests unless `BatchSandbox.spec.replicas=1`.

See [Credential Vault](/guides/credential-vault#persistence-across-pause-and-resume)
for the required post-resume credential re-injection procedure.

## Prerequisites

1. **Kubernetes cluster** with the OpenSandbox controller deployed
2. **OCI-compatible container registry** accessible from cluster nodes (push) and the Kubernetes API (pull)
3. **Kubernetes Secrets** of type `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` for registry authentication
4. **Controller manager** configured with snapshot registry and secret flags

---

## Controller Configuration

Configure the controller manager deployment with snapshot flags:

```yaml
- --snapshot-registry=registry.example.com/sandboxes
- --snapshot-registry-insecure=false
- --snapshot-push-secret=registry-snapshot-push-secret
- --resume-pull-secret=registry-pull-secret
```

### Configuration Reference

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `--snapshot-registry` | string | `""` | **Required.** OCI registry prefix. Images are stored as `<registry>/<sandboxName>-<container>:snap-gen<N>`. |
| `--snapshot-registry-insecure` | bool | `false` | Enables insecure registry mode for snapshot push operations. Use only for HTTP or self-signed local registries. |
| `--snapshot-push-secret` | string | `""` | Kubernetes Secret name for pushing snapshots. Must be `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` type. |
| `--image-committer-pod-template-file` | string | `""` | Path to a PodTemplateSpec overlay for commit Job Pods. |
| `--resume-pull-secret` | string | `""` | Kubernetes Secret name injected into resumed sandboxes for pulling snapshot images. Can be the same as push secret. |
| `--image-committer-image` | string | `"image-committer:dev"` | Image used by commit Jobs. |
| `--commit-job-timeout` | duration | `"10m"` | Timeout for commit Jobs. |

### Helm chart support

The `opensandbox-controller` Helm chart now exposes the snapshot-related controller values directly:

- `controller.snapshot.imageCommitterImage`
- `controller.snapshot.imageCommitterPodTemplate`
- `controller.snapshot.commitJobTimeout`
- `controller.snapshot.registry`
- `controller.snapshot.registryInsecure`
- `controller.snapshot.snapshotPushSecret`
- `controller.snapshot.resumePullSecret`

For the all-in-one `opensandbox` chart, use the same values under the `opensandbox-controller.*` prefix.

### Startup behavior

The server no longer carries dedicated pause/resume config. Missing registry or secret settings are surfaced by the Kubernetes controllers when a `SandboxSnapshot` is processed, for example as `SandboxSnapshot.status.conditions[type=Failed]` with reasons like `RegistryNotConfigured`.

---

## Registry and Secret Setup

### Step 1: Prepare your registry

Any OCI-compatible registry works (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, Harbor, a private `registry:2` instance, etc.). The registry must be:

- **Reachable from cluster nodes** (for the commit Job to push)
- **Reachable from the Kubernetes API server / kubelet** (for image pull on resume)

### Step 2: Create the push secret

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-snapshot-push-secret \
  --docker-server=registry.example.com \
  --docker-username=<username> \
  --docker-password=<password-or-token> \
  --namespace=<sandbox-namespace>
```

### Step 3: Create the pull secret

The pull secret is used by the resumed `BatchSandbox` Pod to pull the snapshot image. It can be the same secret as the push secret if your credentials have both read and write access:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-pull-secret \
  --docker-server=registry.example.com \
  --docker-username=<username> \
  --docker-password=<password-or-token> \
  --namespace=<sandbox-namespace>
```

### Using a private `registry:2` (development)

For development with a cluster-internal `registry:2` deployment:

```bash
# Create a registry deployment
kubectl create deployment docker-registry \
  --image=registry:2 --port=5000

kubectl expose deployment docker-registry --port=5000

# No authentication needed for internal registry
# Leave snapshot push/pull secret flags empty on the controller manager
```

---

## Usage Guide

Once the controller manager is configured and the server is running, pause/resume works through the standard Lifecycle API. No SDK changes are needed.

### Pause a sandbox

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}/pause \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Response:** `202 Accepted` with an empty body.

The pause is asynchronous. The sandbox transitions through:
`running` → `pausing` → `paused`

### Check pause status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}
```

When `status` is `paused`, the filesystem has been committed and cluster resources have been released.

### Resume a sandbox

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}/resume \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Response:** `202 Accepted` with an empty body.

The sandbox transitions through:
`paused` → `resuming` → `running`

### Multiple pause/resume cycles

Pause and resume can be repeated. Each pause cycle produces a new snapshot image tag (`snap-gen1`, `snap-gen2`, ...). The latest snapshot is always used for the next resume.

---

## Administrator Guide

### Controller RBAC

The OpenSandbox controller requires the following RBAC permissions for pause/resume (included in the Helm chart and `make manifests` output):

| Resource | Verbs | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `sandboxsnapshots` | get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete | Manage SandboxSnapshot CRs |
| `jobs` / `jobs/status` | full | Create/monitor commit Jobs |
| `secrets` | get | Validate push secret exists before creating commit Job |
| `pods` | get, list, watch | Find running Pod for commit |

### Snapshot image naming

Internal pause/resume snapshot images are named:
```
<snapshot-registry>/<sandboxName>-<containerName>:snap-gen<N>
```

For example, with `--snapshot-registry=registry.example.com/sandboxes`, sandbox `my-sandbox`, container `sandbox`, first pause:
```
registry.example.com/sandboxes/my-sandbox-sandbox:snap-gen1
```

Server-managed public snapshots use the same repository layout but a stable
snapshot-id-derived tag:
```
<snapshot-registry>/<sandboxName>-<containerName>:snap-<snapshotIdHex>
```

The controller distinguishes the two modes by owner reference. Pause/resume
snapshots are created by the `BatchSandbox` controller and have a controller
ownerReference to the owning `BatchSandbox`; public snapshots are created by the
Lifecycle server and do not use that ownerReference.

### Runtime compatibility

The built-in `rootfs-v1` image committer requires a container runtime that
exposes compatible containerd task pause/resume and writable-snapshot APIs.
gVisor RuntimeClasses whose handler is `runsc` do not currently satisfy that
contract. The Lifecycle server rejects public snapshot creation for those
workloads before it persists a snapshot record or creates a `SandboxSnapshot`
resource, leaving the running sandbox untouched.

Native gVisor checkpoint/restore requires a dedicated snapshot backend and is
not provided by the `rootfs-v1` committer.

### Commit Job

The controller creates a short-lived Kubernetes `Job` for each pause:

- **Job name**: `<snapshotName>-commit`
- **Node affinity**: Runs on the **same node** as the source Pod (containerd socket access required)
- **Timeout**: 10 minutes (`ActiveDeadlineSeconds`)
- **TTL**: 5 minutes after completion (`TTLSecondsAfterFinished`)
- **Image**: `image-committer` (configurable via controller `--image-committer-image` flag)

The commit Job mounts the host containerd socket from the source node and runs as UID 0. This gives the `image-committer` image node-level container runtime access. Use only a trusted image, preferably pinned by digest or controlled by an admission policy.

The built-in image committer uses containerd APIs directly for container lookup, task pause/unpause, writable-snapshot image creation, and registry push. Before committing, it verifies that the node's content store contains every base-image blob for the node platform and fetches missing blobs from the original image digest; this avoids snapshot failures after CRI discards compressed content during image unpack. Source registries use HTTPS by default. For a trusted source registry that requires skipped TLS verification or plain HTTP, inject `SOURCE_IMAGE_REGISTRY_INSECURE=true` into the `commit` container through the image-committer Pod template. The reusable Go contracts and default implementations are exposed in [`pkg/imagecommitter`](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/tree/main/kubernetes/pkg/imagecommitter); provider-specific binaries can supply a credential provider and reuse the standard CLI contract. The Job also retains the host `/run/containerd/fifo` mount so compatible implementations can use containerd task exec. Any preparation command used by the built-in implementation is best effort and does not change the commit interface.

The operator-controlled Pod template can add labels, annotations, a ServiceAccount, scheduling settings, init containers, sidecars, and settings on the required `commit` container such as resources, `env`, and `envFrom`. The template is the merge base, and controller-generated invariants override conflicting template values. The controller reserves the source `nodeName`, restart policy, committer image, image pull policy, command, arguments, security context, termination-message settings, and required environment variables, mounts, and volumes. Environment variables, mounts, and volumes are merged by name, with required controller values winning conflicts. Additional regular sidecars must terminate for the Job to complete.

Any ServiceAccount or admission configuration referenced by the template must exist in every sandbox namespace. Unpause Jobs do not receive the commit Pod template because they do not access the registry.

If the commit Job fails, the controller creates a best-effort `<snapshotName>-unpause` Job on the same node to unpause any source containers that may have been left paused by an abrupt committer exit.

Deleting a `SandboxSnapshot` cleans up Kubernetes commit/unpause Jobs, but does not delete pushed OCI images from the registry. Repeated pause cycles create tags such as `snap-gen<N>`; configure registry retention or garbage collection externally.

### Monitoring

Check SandboxSnapshot status:

```bash
kubectl get sandboxsnapshot -n <namespace>
# NAME          PHASE       SANDBOX_ID     AGE
# my-snapshot   Succeed     my-sandbox     5m

kubectl describe sandboxsnapshot my-snapshot -n <namespace>
```

Key fields to watch:

- `status.phase`: `Pending` → `Committing` → `Succeed` / `Failed`
- `status.conditions`: readiness or failure reasons with human-readable messages
- `status.containers`: image URIs for each committed container
- `status.sourcePodName` / `status.sourceNodeName`: resolved execution source for the snapshot

#### Monitoring Sandbox State Transitions

When checking sandbox state via the Lifecycle API, you'll see intermediate states:

**Pause flow:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}
# Response during pause:
{
  "id": "my-sandbox",
  "status": {
    "state": "Pausing",
    "reason": "PAUSING",
    "message": "Pausing sandbox"
  }
}
```

**Resume flow:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}
# Response during resume:
{
  "id": "my-sandbox",
  "status": {
    "state": "Resuming",
    "reason": "RESUMING",
    "message": "Resuming sandbox"
  }
}
```

## SandboxSnapshot Reference

### Spec fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `sandboxName` | string | Target `BatchSandbox` name in the same namespace |

### Status fields (set by Controller)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `phase` | string | `Pending` / `Committing` / `Succeed` / `Failed` |
| `conditions` | list | `Ready` / `Failed` conditions with reason and message |
| `sourcePodName` | string | Pod name used for commit |
| `sourceNodeName` | string | Node where commit Job runs |
| `containers` | list | `{containerName, imageUri, imageDigest}` per container. `imageDigest` is the image config digest, preserving the image ID semantics of earlier image-committer versions. |
| `observedGeneration` | int | Last processed spec generation |

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Snapshot stuck in `Failed` — push secret not found

**Cause**: The controller manager was configured with a `--snapshot-push-secret` that does not exist in the sandbox namespace.

**Solution**:
```bash
kubectl get secret registry-snapshot-push-secret -n <namespace>
# If missing:
kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-snapshot-push-secret \
  --docker-server=<registry> \
  --docker-username=<user> \
  --docker-password=<token> \
  -n <namespace>
```

The controller validates secret existence **before** creating the commit Job (fail-fast). Once the secret is created, trigger a new pause cycle.

---

### 2. Snapshot stuck in `Committing` for a long time

**Check the commit Job and its Pod:**

```bash
kubectl get job -n <namespace> -l sandbox.opensandbox.io/snapshot=<snapshotName>
kubectl describe pod <commit-pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

**Common causes:**

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `ContainerCreating` for >30s | Secret missing or wrong type | Re-create secret as `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` |
| `FailedMount` event | Secret not found | See issue #1 above |
| Pod running but job never completes | Registry unreachable from node | Check network connectivity from node to registry |
| `unauthorized` in Pod logs | Wrong credentials in secret | Verify secret content with `kubectl get secret ... -o yaml` |

---

### 3. Wrong secret type

Docker registry secrets **must** be type `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`. Generic secrets (`Opaque`) will cause a `FailedMount` error.

```bash
# Check secret type
kubectl get secret registry-snapshot-push-secret -o jsonpath='{.type}'
# Expected: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson

# If wrong type, delete and recreate:
kubectl delete secret registry-snapshot-push-secret
kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-snapshot-push-secret \
  --docker-server=<registry> \
  --docker-username=<user> \
  --docker-password=<token>
```

---

### 4. Registry unreachable (`Committing` → `Failed` after timeout)

**Symptoms**: Commit Job Pod starts, runs for a while, then fails with a push error.

**Check:**

```bash
# Inspect commit Pod logs
kubectl logs <commit-pod-name> -n <namespace>

# Test registry connectivity from a node
kubectl run registry-test --rm -it --image=alpine -- \
  wget -O- https://<registry>/v2/ --timeout=5
```

**Common causes:**
- Registry behind a firewall not accessible from cluster nodes
- Self-signed TLS certificate not trusted by containerd
- Wrong registry URL (http vs https)

---

### 5. Resume accepted but the runtime Pod fails to start

**Cause**: The snapshot image cannot be pulled.

```bash
kubectl describe pod <resumed-pod-name> -n <namespace>
# Look for: ErrImagePull or ImagePullBackOff
```

**Check:**
- `--resume-pull-secret` is correctly configured and the Secret exists in the namespace
- The registry is accessible from the node pulling the image
- The snapshot image was successfully pushed during pause (check `status.containers`)

---

### 6. SandboxSnapshot not being processed (no status)

**Cause**: The OpenSandbox controller is not running.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n opensandbox-system
kubectl logs -n opensandbox-system deployment/opensandbox-controller-manager
```
