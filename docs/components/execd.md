# execd - OpenSandbox Execution Daemon

`execd` is the runtime daemon used inside OpenSandbox sandboxes.

It is built on Gin and exposes HTTP APIs for code execution, shell commands, filesystem operations, PTY sessions, and metrics.

## Quick Start

### 1) Build

```bash
cd components/execd
make build
```

On Linux, `make build` uses the native C compiler and static libc to produce
`bin/opensandbox-session-gate`. The published execd image already installs
this helper. If you run execd from a source build and need isolated sessions,
install it at the fixed trusted runtime path first:

```bash
make build-session-gate
sudo make install-session-gate
# /opt/opensandbox/opensandbox-session-gate (mode 0555)
```

Compilation runs before privilege escalation; the install target only copies
the built helper. Keep `/opt/opensandbox` and the helper root-owned and not
group- or world-writable. Other execd APIs still work without it, but
isolated-session capability probing and creation fail closed.

### 2) Start Jupyter Server

```bash
./tests/jupyter.sh
```

### 3) Run execd

```bash
./bin/execd \
  --jupyter-host=http://127.0.0.1:54321 \
  --jupyter-token=your-jupyter-token \
  --port=44772
```

### 4) Verify

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:44772/ping
```

## API

- OpenAPI spec: [execd-api.yaml](/api/)
- Common capability groups:
  - Runtime init (`/internal/init`, `/ready` — per-allocation RuntimeBinding)
  - Code execution (`/code`, SSE stream)
  - Session and command execution (`/session`, `/command`)
  - Filesystem operations (`/files`, `/directories`)
  - Isolated sessions (`/v1/isolated/session`, bubblewrap namespaces)
  - PTY over WebSocket (`/pty`)
  - Local metrics endpoints (`/metrics`, `/metrics/watch`)

Shell-backed sessions use Bash when it is available and fall back to `sh` on
minimal images that do not include Bash. This applies to PTY sessions, the
Bash session API (which keeps its existing name for compatibility), and
isolated sessions. Commands submitted to a fallback session must use syntax
supported by that image's `sh` implementation.

### Command execution

`POST /command` runs a command in foreground or background mode. Supply either
`command` for shell syntax (such as pipelines and redirection) or `argv` to
execute a program directly with literal arguments.

```json
{
  "argv": ["python3", "-c", "import sys; print(sys.argv[1:])", "a b", "$HOME"],
  "cwd": "$WORKSPACE",
  "envs": {"WORKSPACE": "/workspace"}
}
```

`argv` preserves arguments literally, including empty strings; `$HOME` in this
example is not expanded. Relative executable paths use `cwd`; bare names
search absolute entries in the child `PATH`. Use `./tool` to run a local
executable.

Both modes use the environment priority request `envs` > `EXECD_ENVS` >
sandbox envs (`POST /internal/init`, see [Runtime init](#runtime-init)) > daemon
environment. Request values are literal. `cwd` expands `$NAME` and `${NAME}`
using that environment, and leading `~` using the daemon user's home.
Undefined variables fail validation; omitted `cwd` inherits the daemon
directory.

On Windows, environment names are case-insensitive and arguments use standard
Windows encoding. Batch files require a shell; use absolute paths instead of
drive-relative paths such as `C:tool.exe`. See the [OpenAPI reference](/api/)
for field constraints and executable lookup details.

### Command output retention

Foreground command output is streamed over SSE and its temporary stdout and
stderr files are removed as soon as streaming completes. Completed command
metadata and detached background-command output remain available for 24 hours.
Cleanup runs hourly after that retention window. Running commands are never
removed by retention cleanup.

The command-output janitor also removes matching files older than 24 hours that
were left directly under the system temporary directory by earlier execd
versions. New output is isolated under the `opensandbox-execd` temporary
subdirectory so command files do not accumulate in the shared directory root.

## PTY WebSocket access

The first WebSocket attached to `/pty/{session_id}/ws` is the exclusive
read/write holder. A second read/write connection receives `409 Conflict`
unless it uses `?takeover=1` to replace that holder.

After the read/write holder has started the shell, any number of read-only
clients can attach with:

```text
ws://localhost:44772/pty/{session_id}/ws?mode=viewer&since=0
```

Viewer connections receive the retained replay followed by live output, but
they never acquire or evict the read/write holder. The JSON `connected` frame
sets `role` to `viewer` (holders receive `role: "holder"`) so clients can use
the appropriate binary-frame decoder. Holders receive `0x01` stdout and, in
pipe mode, `0x02` stderr frames. Viewers receive `0x03` replay frames for both
retained and live output: an 8-byte big-endian offset followed by raw bytes.

Binary stdin and JSON `stdin`, `signal`, or `resize` frames are rejected with
a `READ_ONLY` error; `ping` remains available. The server closes a viewer after
five rejected mutating frames to bound error traffic from a misbehaving client.
WebSocket backpressure from a slow or disconnected viewer does not block the
interactive holder's live output pipe. In pipe mode, viewer output uses the
combined replay stream because replay does not preserve stdout/stderr channel
boundaries.

A viewer can attach only while the shell is running. When the shell exits,
viewers receive the `exit` frame and close. If a holder later starts the same
session again, its bounded replay buffer is retained, so a viewer reconnecting
with `since=0` can receive retained output from the preceding shell lifetime.

## Isolated Sessions

Isolated sessions run a shell inside a per-execution
[bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) (`bwrap`) namespace,
created via `POST /v1/isolated/session`. Bash is preferred, with `sh` used as a
fallback. Beyond the workspace, callers can expose additional host paths into
the namespace.

### UID modes and capabilities

The optional `uid_mode` request field selects how identity is established:

- `setpriv` (the default) uses the container's existing user namespace and
  drops to the requested UID/GID with `setpriv`.
- `userns` creates a new user namespace and maps the requested UID/GID inside
  it, which can work in environments where the capabilities required by
  `setpriv` mode are unavailable.

At startup, execd probes both modes independently. `GET
/v1/isolated/capabilities` reports `setpriv_available` and
`userns_available`; the overall `available` field is true when either mode is
usable. Creating a session returns `503 NOT_SUPPORTED` only when the selected
mode is unavailable. The probes exercise the same identity path used at
runtime: the public `setpriv_available` flag covers execd's default UID/GID
path (so a root session that keeps UID/GID 0 does not require the `setpriv`
binary), while `userns` applies the UID/GID mapping and the setuid-aware
`--disable-userns` policy. A setpriv request that selects IDs different from
execd's own is checked against a separate startup identity-switch probe and
returns `503 NOT_SUPPORTED` before session side effects when that switch is not
available.

For a private-network Session (`share_net: false`), execd fixes the
authenticated network namespace and its owning user namespace before the
native workload gate is released. The two namespace bind mounts use an
execd-owned, unpredictable directory below `/run/execd/namespaces` and stay
owned by the Session until synchronous teardown. This applies to both UID
modes; shared-network Sessions do not create namespace pins.

### Bind mounts

Two request fields control extra host paths:

- `extra_writable`: a list of paths bind-mounted read-write at the same path
  inside the namespace (`source == destination`).
- `binds`: explicit `source` → `dest` mappings, each optionally read-only.
  - `source` (required): host path to bind. It must **already exist** and is
    resolved (symlinks followed) before use.
  - `dest`: mount destination inside the namespace; defaults to `source` when
    omitted. It must be an **existing** mount point — `bwrap` cannot create a
    destination under the read-only root, so create the directory first.
  - `readonly` (default `false`): mount read-only (`--ro-bind`) when `true`,
    read-write (`--bind`) otherwise.

Example:

```json
{
  "workspace": { "path": "/workspace", "mode": "rw" },
  "binds": [
    { "source": "/data/in",  "dest": "/mnt/in", "readonly": true },
    { "source": "/data/out", "dest": "/mnt/out" }
  ]
}
```

### Writable allowlist

The source path of every `extra_writable` entry and every `binds` entry must
fall within the `allowed_writable` allowlist (see the isolation config file
below). The allowlist is enforced against the fully symlink-resolved real
path, so a symlink cannot redirect a bind outside the allowlist. An empty
allowlist rejects all `extra_writable`/`binds` requests.

The built-in default allowlist is `/workspace`, `/mnt`, `/media`, `/data`
(subpaths included). Set `allowed_writable` in the isolation config to
override it.

## Configuration

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--jupyter-host` | `""` | Jupyter server URL reachable by execd. |
| `--jupyter-token` | `""` | Jupyter token for HTTP/WebSocket auth. |
| `--port` | `44772` | HTTP listen port. |
| `--log-level` | `6` | Log level (0=Emergency, 7=Debug). |
| `--access-token` | `""` | Optional shared API access token. |
| `--graceful-shutdown-timeout` | `200ms` | SSE tail-drain wait window before closing. |
| `--jupyter-idle-poll-interval` | `100ms` | Poll interval after Jupyter reports idle. |
| `--isolation-config` | `""` | Path to the isolation TOML config (see below). |
| `--init` | `false` | Run as the sandbox init (OSEP-0018): reap children, forward signals, own the container lifecycle. Set together with `EXECD_INIT`; see [Init mode](#init-mode). |
| `--runtime-init` | `false` | Gate preStart and the entrypoint on `POST /internal/init`: until the control plane applies the RuntimeBinding, only `/ping`, `/ready`, and `/internal/init` are served. See [Runtime init](#runtime-init). |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `JUPYTER_HOST` | Same as `--jupyter-host` (overridden by explicit flag). |
| `JUPYTER_TOKEN` | Same as `--jupyter-token` (overridden by explicit flag). |
| `EXECD_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Same as `--access-token` (overridden by explicit flag). |
| `EXECD_API_GRACE_SHUTDOWN` | Same as `--graceful-shutdown-timeout`. |
| `EXECD_JUPYTER_IDLE_POLL_INTERVAL` | Same as `--jupyter-idle-poll-interval`. |
| `EXECD_ISOLATION_CONFIG` | Same as `--isolation-config`. |
| `EXECD_RUNTIME_INIT` | Same as `--runtime-init`. Never forwarded to user processes. |
| `EXECD_INIT` | Init-mode switch read by `bootstrap.sh`: when truthy (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`), the script `exec`s `execd --init -- <user command>` so execd becomes PID 1; see [Init mode](#init-mode). Unset preserves the classic background-and-wait topology. |
| `EXECD_CLONE3_COMPAT` | Linux clone3 compatibility switch (see below). |
| `EXECD_LOG_FILE` | Optional log output file path; default is stdout. |
| `EXECD_ENVS` | Optional file of `KEY=VALUE` lines supplying environment variables for commands and bash sessions. Values expand daemon environment variables; blank lines and `#` comments are ignored. Bash session `cwd` values also expand `$NAME` and `${NAME}` using the session environment. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` | Preferred OTLP metrics endpoint. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Fallback OTLP endpoint when metrics-specific endpoint is unset. |
| `OPENSANDBOX_ID` | Sandbox id stamped into eBPF audit records (`sandbox_id`) and metrics; the server injects it on Docker/Kubernetes task-template paths. When a RuntimeBinding is applied via `POST /internal/init`, its `sandboxId` becomes authoritative and is also forced into every user-process environment. Lifecycle Pool requests always schedule a task template and receive this value. Direct BatchSandbox resources that omit the task template cannot inject it; with the eBPF layer enabled, execd starts the observer in a degraded "attribution pending" state and binds the id when `/internal/init` arrives. |
| `OPENSANDBOX_EXECD_METRICS_EXTRA_ATTRS` | Optional extra metric attrs (`k=v,k2=v2`). |

### Transparent MITM CA trust

When transparent MITM is enabled, `bootstrap.sh` installs the exported CA into
the available system, NSS, and JDK trust stores on a best-effort basis. The
official execd image includes `certutil` through Alpine's `nss-tools` package,
so it can update the per-user NSS database used by Chromium and Chrome when
that image is used directly.

The Docker and Kubernetes runtime injection paths copy execd, `bootstrap.sh`,
and static helpers into the workload image. They do not copy the execd image's
dynamic NSS libraries or package database. A custom workload image that needs
Chromium or Chrome trust must therefore install its native `certutil` package,
such as `nss-tools` on Alpine or `libnss3-tools` on Debian/Ubuntu. If
`certutil` is absent, bootstrap logs a warning and continues; other available
trust-store integrations still run, but Chromium or Chrome may reject the
intercepted certificate.

### Lifecycle hook trust boundary

`execd` runs configured `preStart` and `periodic` commands directly as its own
OS user in the sandbox's existing container namespaces. Lifecycle hooks do not
use isolated-session confinement.

Lifecycle hooks are trusted setup and maintenance code, not a security or
policy boundary. The default persisted config at
`$HOME/.execd/lifecycle.toml` is writable by execd's user, and a root sandbox
workload can modify or remove it. Do not use hooks for tamper-resistant
auditing or mandatory controls against sandbox workloads.

### Isolation Config File

Isolated sessions read an optional TOML file given by `--isolation-config`
(or `EXECD_ISOLATION_CONFIG`). All fields are optional; omitted fields use
built-in defaults.

```toml
# Parent directory for per-session overlay upper directories.
upper_root = "/var/lib/execd/isolation"

# Host paths callers may request via extra_writable / binds.
# Enforced against the fully symlink-resolved real path; subpaths are allowed.
# Default: ["/workspace", "/mnt", "/media", "/data"]. Empty = reject all.
allowed_writable = ["/workspace", "/mnt", "/media", "/data"]
```

### Hardening Floor

The pre-exec privilege floor (OSEP-0018 §4) is off by default. Enable it in
the same isolation TOML:

```toml
[hardening]
enabled = true

# Capabilities the workload keeps (raised in the ambient set).
# Default: drop all. Names use the CAP_ prefix.
keep_capabilities = []

# Optional: replace the built-in syscall denylist. With hardening enabled,
# "execve" is reserved for the launcher's final exec and is rejected at
# startup ("execveat" stays allowed).
[seccomp]
deny = ["mount", "ptrace", "bpf", "seccomp"]

# Optional: Landlock filesystem confinement on top of the floor.
[landlock]
enabled = true
extra_writable = []   # writable paths beyond the built-in set
extra_readable = []   # read-only paths beyond the built-in set
```

When enabled, every user-code process (entrypoint, `/command`, `/code`,
PTY) is launched through the `opensandbox-launcher` native helper, which
applies the floor between fork and exec: execd credential env vars are
stripped, the bounding set is trimmed to `keep_capabilities` (none by
default), `no_new_privs` is set, the identity is dropped to the image's
user, kept caps are raised in the ambient set, and the seccomp filter is
installed last. Isolated-session workloads are already reduced inside the
bwrap namespace and are not additionally wrapped.

Everything is fail-open and reported on `GET /v1/isolated/capabilities`
under `hardening.cap_drop` / `hardening.seccomp` / `hardening.landlock`
(`active` | `degraded` | `unsupported` | `disabled` with a reason message).
Missing `CAP_SETPCAP` degrades the cap drop but keeps seccomp; a missing
launcher binary disables the floor; a kernel without Landlock (ABI < 1)
reports `unsupported` and skips FS confinement.

With `[landlock] enabled`, user-code processes are allowlisted to: system
paths (`/usr`, `/bin`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/etc`) read+exec, `/proc/self`
and `/proc/sys` read+exec (never all of `/proc`, which would re-expose
`/proc/1` and execd's credentials), the needed `/dev` device files and the
controlling tty, `/tmp`, `/run`, `allowed_writable`, plus
`extra_writable`/`extra_readable`. Everything else is denied. Note that
only the initial workload process keeps `/proc/self` access (a Landlock
rule is inode-based); forked descendants lose their own `/proc/self` —
tooling that needs it should be run as the entrypoint process.

Two Landlock kernel behaviors shape the policy:

- `path_beneath` rules are scoped to the mount the path belongs to, so at
  startup execd expands every rule onto each mount point beneath it —
  bind-mounted workspaces (a separate mount) get the same access as their
  parent path.
- rules only accept directory parents, so per-file grants are impossible;
  well-known proc files (`/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`, …) are not
  individually readable under Landlock.

Recommended container ceiling (operator side): keep `CAP_SETPCAP`,
`CAP_SETUID`, `CAP_SETGID` so execd can reduce children; drop the rest
(`NET_RAW`, `SYS_MODULE`, `SYS_TIME`, `SYS_TTY_CONFIG`, `AUDIT_WRITE`,
`MKNOD`).

### eBPF Observation

Opt-in exec/connect/privilege audit (OSEP-0018 §5), off by default:

```toml
[ebpf]
enabled = true
observe = ["exec", "connect", "privilege"]   # default: all three
audit_file = "/var/log/opensandbox/ebpf-audit.jsonl"  # rotated JSONL
```

Requires the `execd-ebpf` build variant (CGO + `cilium/ebpf`), a
container with `CAP_BPF` + `CAP_PERFMON`, and a BTF-capable kernel —
Linux ≥ 5.10 with `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF` (5.10–5.15 kernels use the
inline-`filename` trace event layout, which the BPF program detects via
CO-RE; 5.16+ use the `__data_loc` layout). Events are scoped to the
sandbox cgroup, so only this sandbox's processes are observed; they are
written as JSONL (one object per line) with a stable common envelope
(`ts`, `event`, `sandbox_id`, `pid`, `comm`) plus per-kind fields
(`filename`/`ppid` for `exec`, `dst_ip`/`dst_port`/`proto` for
`connect`, uid/gid deltas and `cap_added` for `privilege`). Under
gVisor/Kata the host kernel is not attachable, and the layer reports
`unsupported`. Missing prerequisites never block startup.

The default image ships both binaries: `execd` (the static default variant,
without eBPF code) and `execd-ebpf` (the observation variant with CGO +
cilium/ebpf, built in the Dockerfile's `ebpf-builder` stage and copied
alongside `execd`). `make build-ebpf` produces the standalone
`bin/execd-ebpf` variant. Server-side selection of the observation binary
based on `[ebpf] enabled` is not wired up yet, so run the `execd-ebpf`
binary explicitly when observation is required.

## Observability

### OpenTelemetry Metrics

OTLP metrics export is enabled when either endpoint is set:

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT`
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`

For node-IP fallback behavior, standard disable switches, supported transport,
and cumulative/delta export settings, see [component telemetry configuration](/guides/component-telemetry).

### Local Metrics Endpoints

- `GET /metrics`: point-in-time host metrics snapshot
- `GET /metrics/watch`: SSE stream (1s cadence)

## Runtime init

Container templates only keep configuration that does not change during the
container lifetime. Everything that is decided when a sandbox is created,
resumed, or re-assigned from a resource pool arrives via `POST /internal/init` as a
**RuntimeBinding**: the authoritative sandbox id, the execd API token hash,
sandbox-level user envs, the lifecycle configuration, and telemetry
attributes.

```json
POST /internal/init
{
  "sandboxId": "sandbox-123",
  "generation": 7,
  "accessTokenHash": "sha256:...",
  "envs": {"APP_ENV": "production"},
  "lifecycle": {
    "preStart": {"command": ["/bin/prepare.sh"], "timeoutSeconds": 60},
    "periodic": []
  },
  "telemetry": {"attributes": {"tenant_id": "tenant-a"}},
  "entrypointPolicy": "restart"
}
```

Processing order:

1. Validate the request (sandbox id, generation, env keys, token hash,
   lifecycle, telemetry attributes, entrypoint policy).
2. Stop the previous generation: periodic hooks, user sessions (commands,
   bash, PTY, jupyter kernels), isolated sessions, and — unless the
   entrypoint policy is `keep` — the previous entrypoint process tree.
3. Apply the RuntimeBinding atomically — API authentication, environment
   resolution, and telemetry attribution switch to the new sandbox in one
   swap. eBPF audit attribution binds the new sandbox id.
4. Run `preStart`, start the periodic hooks.
5. Apply the entrypoint policy (see below).
6. Mark execd ready: `GET /ready` returns 200.

Semantics:

- **Strictly one-shot**: the first *valid* call consumes the init slot for
  the container's lifetime — regardless of whether the apply succeeds. Any
  later call is rejected with `409 ALREADY_INITIALIZED` without waiting;
  malformed requests (`400`) do not consume the slot. There is no re-init
  and no idempotent replay: if a response is lost, reconcile with
  `GET /ready` (it reports the applied `sandboxId` and `generation`); if an
  apply fails (`500`, e.g. preStart or entrypoint failure), the control
  plane recycles the container.
- **Generation**: the control-plane-assigned allocation counter. It is the
  identity of this one-shot init (echoed by `/ready` and stamped onto
  metrics); it is not compared monotonically because a second `/internal/init` is
  always rejected.
- **Entrypoint policy** (`entrypointPolicy`, default `keep`): by default
  execd never starts or restarts the user entrypoint.
  - `keep`: a running entrypoint (legacy fallback path) is adopted as-is —
    signal forwarding and the container exit code stay with it, but it keeps
    the template env. In gated mode nothing starts, turning the container
    into an API-only sandbox; a warning is returned when a template
    entrypoint was suppressed.
  - `restart` (init mode only): retire the running entrypoint and start a
    fresh one with the RuntimeBinding env. In classic mode execd does not
    own the entrypoint, so the request is ignored with a warning.
- **Token rotation**: `/internal/init` receives only `sha256:<hex>` of the raw token.
  After apply, API authentication verifies request tokens against the hash
  and the legacy `EXECD_ACCESS_TOKEN` container-env token is no longer
  accepted. `/internal/init` itself must not be authenticated with the token it
  delivers; the first version relies on control-plane network position.
- **Envs**: replace semantics with layering
  `daemon env (filtered) < sandbox envs (/internal/init) < EXECD_ENVS file < session env < request env`.
  A later `/internal/init` that omits a key removes it. Keys reserved by execd
  (`EXECD_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `JUPYTER_TOKEN`, ...) are rejected.
- **Lifecycle**: when the `lifecycle` field is omitted, the template-level
  configuration keeps applying; when present (even empty), it replaces it.
  Binding a new generation stops the previous periodic hooks before preStart
  runs.
- **Telemetry**: the OTLP exporter is created at execd startup; `/internal/init` only
  updates the dynamic attributes. Metrics are stamped with the current
  `sandbox_id`, `generation`, and the request's attributes at record time.

Before a successful `/internal/init`, only `/ping`, `/ready`, and `/internal/init` are served.

Compatibility:

- **Legacy control planes**: when `--runtime-init` / `EXECD_RUNTIME_INIT` is
  not set, execd keeps the template-driven startup (preStart + entrypoint at
  boot, container-env token). `/internal/init` is still accepted any time and becomes
  authoritative on apply.
- **Resource-pool mode** sets `EXECD_RUNTIME_INIT=1`: execd skips the
  template-driven startup entirely and waits for `/internal/init` (the startup
  sequence above must not fall back to the legacy protocol, or envs, tokens,
  and observability attribution would leak across sandboxes).
- New execd advertises `runtimeInit.version = 1` on
  `GET /v1/isolated/capabilities` so control planes can detect support.

Gating scope by topology:

- **Init mode** (`EXECD_INIT=1`, execd supervises the entrypoint): full
  gating — nothing user-owned runs before `/internal/init`. By default the entrypoint
  is not started (`entrypointPolicy=keep`, API-only sandbox); `restart`
  starts it with the RuntimeBinding env.
- **Classic mode with a lifecycle config**: bootstrap waits on the lifecycle
  status file (armed with a 10-second watchdog) before launching the user
  command, so `/internal/init` must arrive within that window; the entrypoint itself
  stays owned by bootstrap and is never restarted.
- **Classic mode without a lifecycle config**: bootstrap launches the user
  command immediately, so gating cannot cover the entrypoint — only the
  binding (envs, token, attribution) applies to workloads started afterwards.
  Resource-pool deployments should use init mode for the full contract.

## Init mode

[OSEP-0018](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/blob/main/oseps/0018-execd-as-sandbox-init.md) makes execd the sandbox
init: it becomes the parent of the user entrypoint, reaps every child through
a single reaper, forwards application signals, and propagates the entrypoint
exit code to the container runtime.

Init mode is **off by default** and gated by two settings set in lockstep:

- `EXECD_INIT` (read by `bootstrap.sh`): decides the process topology — the
  script `exec`s into `execd --init -- <user command>` so execd inherits PID 1
  (Docker / K8s Batch paths), instead of backgrounding execd and the user
  command as siblings.
- `--init` (read by execd): activates the init duties (reaper, signal
  forwarding, lifecycle). If execd is not PID 1 (e.g. the K8s Pool task path,
  or a stray `&`), it degrades to subreaper mode: orphan reaping works, but
  the kernel PID 1 signal shield does not.

Behavioral contract in init mode:

- The user entrypoint owns the container lifecycle: when it exits, execd
  stops the remaining children (`SIGTERM` → grace → `SIGKILL`) and exits with
  the entrypoint's status.
- `HUP`/`USR1`/`USR2`/`WINCH` are forwarded to the entrypoint process group.
- `SIGTERM` (runtime-initiated container stop) is forwarded to the workload
  and starts the graceful shutdown sequence.
- In-namespace `kill -9 1` is inert (kernel signal shield). A workload
  `kill 1` (SIGTERM) is treated like a runtime stop; the trusted out-of-band
  stop channel is a follow-up (see the OSEP, §3).
- The actual mode is reported on `GET /v1/isolated/capabilities` under
  `hardening.init_mode` (`pid1` | `subreaper` | `none`).

### Pool (pre-warmed) sandboxes

Pool tasks are executed by the task-executor with `bootstrap.sh <entrypoint>`.
With `execd_run_as_init` enabled, the generated task no longer backgrounds
bootstrap: the task-executor's shim shell execs bootstrap, which execs
`execd --init`, so execd becomes the root of the task process tree —
orphaned task children are reaped (subreaper mode, since the task process is
not the container's PID 1) and the entrypoint exit code propagates back to
the shim and the task status.

To make execd the *container's* PID 1 in pooled pods, the operator's Pool pod
template should start the main container with `bootstrap.sh` plus a
keep-alive entrypoint and `EXECD_INIT=1`:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: sandbox
          image: opensandbox/execd:latest
          command: ["/bootstrap.sh", "/bin/sh", "-c", "while :; do sleep 3600; done"]
          env:
            - name: EXECD_INIT
              value: "1"
            - name: EXECD
              value: /execd
```

execd then stays alive as PID 1 (reaping + kernel signal shield) while the
task-executor keeps running user tasks in the pod. The K8s Restart recycle
strategy (`kill 1` via pod exec) keeps working against init-mode execd: the
signal is forwarded and execd exits with the workload's status, so the
kubelet restarts the container.

## Linux clone3 Compatibility
Some sandbox environments fail on `clone3(2)`.
Set `EXECD_CLONE3_COMPAT` in sandbox env to force fallback behavior:

- `1` / `true` / `yes` / `on`: enable seccomp fallback
- `reexec`: enable fallback and re-exec binary
