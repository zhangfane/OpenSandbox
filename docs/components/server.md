# OpenSandbox Server

A production-grade, FastAPI-based service for managing the lifecycle of containerized sandboxes. It acts as the control plane to create, run, monitor, and dispose isolated execution environments across container platforms.

## Features

### Core capabilities
- **Lifecycle APIs**: Standardized REST interfaces for create, start, pause, resume, delete
- **Pluggable runtimes**:
  - **Docker**: Production-ready
  - **Kubernetes**: Production-ready (see [Kubernetes Controller](/kubernetes/) for deployment)
- **Lifecycle cleanup modes**: Configurable TTL with renewal, or manual cleanup with explicit delete
- **Access control**: API Key authentication (`OPEN-SANDBOX-API-KEY`); can be disabled for local/dev
- **Networking modes**:
  - Host: shared host network, performance first
  - Bridge: isolated network with built-in HTTP routing
- **Resource quotas**: CPU/memory limits with Kubernetes-style specs
- **Observability**: Unified status with transition tracking
- **Registry support**: Public and private images

### Extended capabilities
- **Async provisioning**: Background creation to reduce latency
- **Timer restoration**: Expiration timers restored after restart
- **Env/metadata injection**: Per-sandbox environment and metadata
- **Port resolution**: Dynamic endpoint generation
- **Structured errors**: Standard error codes and messages

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **Package Manager**: [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip
- **Runtime Backend**:
  - Docker Engine 20.10+ (for Docker runtime)
  - Kubernetes 1.21.1+ (for Kubernetes runtime)
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL2

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install from PyPI. For local development, clone the repo and run `uv sync` in `server/`.

::: code-group

```bash [pip]
pip install opensandbox-server
```

```bash [uv]
uv pip install opensandbox-server
```

:::

### Configuration

The server reads a **TOML** file. Default path: `~/.sandbox.toml`. Override with **`SANDBOX_CONFIG_PATH`** or **`opensandbox-server --config /path/to/sandbox.toml`**.

1. Generate a starter file (see `opensandbox-server -h` for all flags):

```bash
opensandbox-server init-config ~/.sandbox.toml --example docker
# Kubernetes: --example k8s  (deploy the operator / CRDs per kubernetes/ first)
# Locales: docker-zh | k8s-zh  |  omit --example for a schema-only skeleton  |  add --force to overwrite
```

2. Edit the file for your environment. Full reference: [configuration.md](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/blob/main/server/configuration.md) (all keys, defaults, validation, env vars).

   Topics covered there include: Docker `network_mode` / `host_ip` and `[proxy] resolve_internal` (e.g. server in Docker Compose), `[egress]` when clients send `networkPolicy`, `[ingress]`, `[secure_runtime]`, Kubernetes `workload_provider` / `batchsandbox_template_file`, `[agent_sandbox]`, TTL caps, `[renew_intent]`.
   The server-wide persistence backend is configured under `[store]`; by default OpenSandbox uses a local SQLite database at `~/.opensandbox/opensandbox.db` for server-managed metadata such as snapshot records. PostgreSQL can be selected for externally managed persistence; see the [store configuration](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/blob/main/server/configuration.md#store).

### Fast Sandbox workload and network policy {#fast-sandbox-workload-and-network-policy}

Fast Sandbox images/templates must include and start execd on port `44772`. Do not
declare execd as a runtime Infra Component: Ingress resolves its raw port just
like other workload ports. See [Ingress](/components/ingress).

`POST /v1/sandboxes` accepts `networkPolicy` for Fast Sandbox. The server includes its
JSON in the initial FastPath `egress` action binding. The selected SandboxPool
must declare the `egress` Action Handler and run a compatible egress process.
The handler is shared by the Fastlet's sandboxes, with separate per-sandbox policy
state. It is not execd injection and does not require an execd Infra Component.

Runtime policy operations use the authenticated lifecycle API, not a public
endpoint to the Fastlet's port `18080`:

```http
PUT /v1/sandboxes/fsb-<id>/networkpolicy
OPEN-SANDBOX-API-KEY: <api-key>
Content-Type: application/json

{"defaultAction":"deny","egress":[{"action":"allow","target":"example.com"}]}
```

GET on the same path reads the persisted policy. PUT replaces the complete
policy; it does not merge rules. Unrelated action bindings retain their values
and order. Concurrent writes are protected by Sandbox UID/generation fences
and return `409` on conflict. Other tenants' sandboxes return `404`.

For Fast Sandbox, `200` means intent was committed, not that network enforcement has
already converged. `mode` is derived from that intent; `enforcementMode` is not
reported. An absent/cleared binding resets a configured Actions handler to
deny-first. This response does not prove that a pool without an egress handler
enforces any policy. Use an explicit `{"defaultAction":"allow","egress":[]}`
to allow all. No PATCH/DELETE rule-management or SDK additions are included in
this increment. For non-Fast Sandbox IDs, GET/PUT proxy the existing sidecar `/policy`.

### PostgreSQL persistence

Set the backend in the TOML configuration and inject the connection string through the environment:

```toml
[store]
type = "postgresql"

[store.postgresql]
min_pool_size = 1
max_pool_size = 10
snapshot_recovery_interval_seconds = 15
```

```bash
export OPENSANDBOX_STORE_POSTGRESQL_DSN='postgresql://opensandbox:password@postgres:5432/opensandbox?sslmode=require'
opensandbox-server
```

::: info
Multiple active Server processes are supported for public snapshots only when
PostgreSQL is paired with the Kubernetes runtime. They observe the deterministic
`SandboxSnapshot` CR before creating it, recover unfinished PostgreSQL rows
periodically, and use state CAS for the terminal database result. A process
crash or transient Kubernetes observation timeout therefore leaves the row
recoverable instead of assigning a database lease.
:::

::: warning
SQLite and Docker snapshot execution keep their existing single-process
recovery behavior. The PostgreSQL recovery interval changes peer takeover
latency for Kubernetes snapshots; it does not provide an exactly-once guarantee
across PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, and the image registry.
:::

The Helm chart still defaults to one Server replica. An explicitly configured
two-replica topology is supported for public snapshots only under the
PostgreSQL-plus-Kubernetes conditions above. For Secret, configuration, and
Helm values wiring, see
[Kubernetes Deployment](/kubernetes/deployment#use-postgresql-for-server-persistence).

### OpenTelemetry metrics

The Server can export metrics through OTLP when `[otel].enabled = true`. It uses
the configured OTLP HTTP endpoint and does not expose a Prometheus `/metrics`
listener.

| Metric | Type | Unit | Attributes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `server.http.request.duration` | Histogram | `ms` | `http_method`, `http_route`, `http_status_code` |
| `opensandbox.sandbox.create.duration` | Histogram | `ms` | `sdk.language`, `sdk.version`, `success` |

HTTP metrics use matched route templates such as `/v1/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}`,
not raw paths. Requests that do not reach a matched route, including early
authentication failures, use `http_route=unknown`. Sandbox IDs, tenant IDs,
API keys, bodies, and query strings are never metric attributes. Standard HTTP
methods are recorded in uppercase, while extension methods use
`http_method=OTHER` to keep attribute cardinality bounded.

The HTTP histogram's sample count can be used for request rate, its status-code
attribute for error rate, and its buckets for latency percentiles. See the
[Server configuration reference](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/blob/main/server/configuration.md#otel)
for the complete `[otel]` settings.

### Run the server

```bash
opensandbox-server
# opensandbox-server --config /path/to/sandbox.toml
```

Listens on `server.host` / `server.port` from your TOML (defaults in [configuration.md](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/blob/main/server/configuration.md)).

**Health check** (adjust host/port if you changed them):

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
# -> {"status": "healthy"}
```

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, interactive API documentation is available:

- **Swagger UI**: [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs)
- **ReDoc**: [http://localhost:8080/redoc](http://localhost:8080/redoc)

### API Authentication

Authentication is enforced only when `server.api_key` is set. If the value is empty or missing, the middleware skips API Key checks; however startup requires explicit risk acknowledgment. In interactive TTY mode, type `YES` when prompted. In non-interactive environments (Docker/Kubernetes/CI), set `OPENSANDBOX_INSECURE_SERVER=YES` to proceed. For production, always set a non-empty `server.api_key` and send it via the `OPEN-SANDBOX-API-KEY` header.

::: warning
Strongly recommend enabling `server.api_key`. See [security report Issue #750](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/OpenSandbox/issues/750).
:::

All API endpoints (except `/health`, `/docs`, `/redoc`) require authentication via the `OPEN-SANDBOX-API-KEY` header when authentication is enabled:

```bash
curl -H "OPEN-SANDBOX-API-KEY: your-secret-api-key" http://localhost:8080/v1/sandboxes
```

### Example Usage

**Create a Sandbox**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/sandboxes" \
  -H "OPEN-SANDBOX-API-KEY: your-secret-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "image": {
      "uri": "python:3.11-slim"
    },
    "entrypoint": [
      "python",
      "-m",
      "http.server",
      "8000"
    ],
    "timeout": 3600,
    "resourceLimits": {
      "cpu": "500m",
      "memory": "512Mi"
    },
    "env": {
      "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "team": "backend",
      "project": "api-testing"
    }
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab",
  "status": {
    "state": "Pending",
    "reason": "CONTAINER_STARTING",
    "message": "Sandbox container is starting.",
    "lastTransitionAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "team": "backend",
    "project": "api-testing"
  },
  "expiresAt": "2024-01-15T11:30:00Z",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "entrypoint": ["python", "-m", "http.server", "8000"]
}
```

**Resource limits**: The request above limits the sandbox to 0.5 CPU cores (`500m`) and 512 MiB of memory (`512Mi`). With the Docker runtime, invalid CPU or memory limits return HTTP 400 (`INVALID_PARAMETER`).

**Other lifecycle calls** (same `OPEN-SANDBOX-API-KEY` header): `GET /v1/sandboxes/{id}`, `POST /v1/sandboxes/{id}/pause`, `POST /v1/sandboxes/{id}/resume`, `GET /v1/sandboxes/{id}/endpoints/{port}` (append `?use_server_proxy=true` when needed), `POST .../renew-expiration`, `DELETE /v1/sandboxes/{id}`. Full request/response shapes: **Swagger UI** above or OpenAPI under [specs/](/api/).

When a server-proxied HTTP route cannot connect to the selected sandbox backend,
the server returns HTTP `502` with error code `BACKEND_CONNECTION_FAILED`. Use the
code, rather than the human-readable message, to classify this failure.

For Kubernetes-backed sandboxes, pause/resume is implemented via `BatchSandbox.spec.pause` and internal `SandboxSnapshot` resources. The externally visible lifecycle transitions are `Running -> Pausing -> Paused -> Resuming -> Running`.

`secureAccess` currently applies only to **Kubernetes** sandboxes exposed through **ingress gateway mode**. Direct endpoint exposure, including non-gateway ingress configurations, is not supported for secured access.

## Architecture

### Component Responsibilities

- **API Layer** (`opensandbox_server/api/`): HTTP request handling, validation, and response formatting
- **Service Layer** (`opensandbox_server/services/`): Business logic for sandbox lifecycle operations
- **Middleware** (`opensandbox_server/middleware/`): Cross-cutting concerns (authentication, logging)
- **Configuration** (`opensandbox_server/config.py`): Centralized configuration management
- **Runtime Implementations**: Platform-specific sandbox orchestration

```

### Failure recovery and `resume`

`resume` is a pause-state operation, not a general restart operation. The API
accepts it only for a sandbox in `Paused` and returns `409 Conflict` for a
container or workload that has already exited into `Terminated` or `Failed`.
It does not restart an externally stopped Docker container.

Runtime restart behavior is configured below the Lifecycle API:

- **Docker**: OpenSandbox does not set a Docker restart policy on sandbox
  containers. If the entrypoint exits or an operator stops the container, the
  sandbox becomes `Terminated` for exit code 0 or `Failed` for a non-zero exit.
- **Kubernetes BatchSandbox**: container restart behavior follows the effective
  Pod template's `restartPolicy`. The example Linux template uses `Never`, but
  operators can supply a different template when its lifecycle and state-loss
  tradeoffs are acceptable. OpenSandbox reports the resulting workload state;
  it does not turn `resume` into a restart of a failed Pod.

To continue after a terminal failure, create a replacement sandbox and update
the caller to use its new sandbox ID. Ordinary recreation starts from the
configured image and persistent volume contents; it does not recover process
memory or unpersisted container filesystem changes. For an intentional
state-preserving suspension, call `pause` while the sandbox is healthy and then
`resume`. Kubernetes pause/resume keeps the same sandbox ID and restores the
captured root filesystem, but not running processes or memory; see
[Pause and Resume](/guides/pause-resume).

TTL is an absolute expiration time. Runtime or server restarts do not reset it:
the Docker server restores timers for managed containers after a server
restart, and Kubernetes keeps `spec.expireTime` on the workload. A newly
created replacement receives its own ID and expiration time from its new create
request.

## Experimental Features

Optional experimental behavior; off by default. See release notes before production.

### Auto-Renew on Access

Extends sandbox TTL when traffic is observed (lifecycle proxy and/or ingress + optional Redis queue). Per-sandbox: on create, set `extensions["access.renew.extend.seconds"]` (string integer 300-86400). Clients using the server proxy: request endpoints with `use_server_proxy=true` (REST) or SDK `ConnectionConfig(..., use_server_proxy=True)`.
