title: QEMU VMState Snapshots
description: Configure and operate process-level pause and resume for QEMU running inside a runc sandbox.

# QEMU VMState Snapshots

This guide explains how to prepare, deploy, and validate a QEMU-in-runc
workload that supports process-level pause and resume. The workload runs QEMU
inside a normal runc container; it does not use a virtualized Kubernetes
`RuntimeClass`.

This mode is experimental. It restores the QEMU Guest memory, vCPU, and
migratable device state. Other processes in the outer runc container restart
from the `BatchSandbox` Pod template.

The initial `qemu-v1` implementation supports pause and resume of the same
`BatchSandbox`. The public snapshot clone API does not yet restore QEMU VMState
because its snapshot record does not persist the complete Pod template and
QEMU launch plan. A standalone public snapshot operation resumes its source VM
after publishing the artifacts.

## State and artifact model

| State | Storage |
|---|---|
| Outer container rootfs | Existing rootfs snapshot image |
| Writable guest qcow2 overlay | Rootfs snapshot image; the overlay must not be under a Kubernetes volume mount |
| Guest RAM, vCPU, and emulated device state | VMState image containing a zstd-compressed QEMU migration stream |
| Immutable guest base image | Original image layer or an independently available read-only volume |
| PVC, hostPath, cloud disk, network peer state | Not copied by OpenSandbox |

Both images are pushed to the configured image Registry and recorded by manifest digest in one `SandboxSnapshot.status`. Resume never relies on mutable tags.

## Prepare the QEMU workload image

QEMU support is a contract between the workload image and OpenSandbox. The
image must:

1. start QEMU with a QMP Unix socket;
2. generate an OpenSandbox launch manifest from the effective QEMU settings;
3. keep each writable Guest overlay captured by v1 in the container rootfs;
4. recognize the OpenSandbox restore environment and add QEMU `-incoming`;
5. become Ready only after the QMP socket and Guest service are available.

### Declare the Pod template contract

Set these annotations on the Pod template that creates the QEMU container. For
a standalone sandbox, use `BatchSandbox.spec.template.metadata`. For a pooled
sandbox, use `Pool.spec.template.metadata` so the allocated Pod carries the
contract.

```yaml
annotations:
  sandbox.opensandbox.io/checkpoint-provider: qemu
  sandbox.opensandbox.io/qemu-container: qemu
  sandbox.opensandbox.io/qemu-qmp-socket: /run/qemu/qmp.sock
  sandbox.opensandbox.io/qemu-launch-manifest: /run/qemu/launch.json
  # Optional: constrain restore to compatible nodes.
  sandbox.opensandbox.io/qemu-required-node-class: shenlong-v1
```

| Annotation | Required | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `checkpoint-provider` | Yes | Selects the `qemu` provider. OpenSandbox does not scan process names. |
| `qemu-container` | Yes | Names the Pod container that owns QEMU, QMP, and the launch manifest. |
| `qemu-qmp-socket` | Yes | Clean absolute path of the QMP Unix socket inside that container. |
| `qemu-launch-manifest` | Yes | Clean absolute path of the OpenSandbox launch manifest inside that container. |
| `qemu-required-node-class` | No | Restricts restore to nodes carrying the matching OpenSandbox QEMU node-class label. |

The paths are container paths. They do not need to be mounted into the
controller Pod. The snapshot worker reaches the target container through the
node container runtime.

### Generate the OpenSandbox launch manifest

The launch manifest is defined by OpenSandbox. It is not a native QEMU file,
and QEMU does not create it automatically. The workload image owner is
responsible for producing it before the Pod becomes Ready.

Generate the file in the container entrypoint from the same effective values
used to build the QEMU command. Do not bake a static file into the Docker image
when CPU, memory, disks, or devices can change through environment variables or
the Pod template.

Example launch manifest:

```json
{
  "formatVersion": "qemu-v1",
  "architecture": "amd64",
  "qemuVersion": "6.2.0",
  "machineType": "pc-q35-6.2",
  "cpuModel": "host",
  "vcpus": 2,
  "memoryBytes": 536870912,
  "qemuConfigDigest": "sha256:...",
  "disks": [
    {
      "id": "osdisk",
      "overlayPath": "/vm/state.qcow2",
      "capture": "rootfs"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `formatVersion` | Must be `qemu-v1`. |
| `architecture` | Guest host architecture used by QEMU, for example `amd64`. |
| `qemuVersion` | Version reported by the running QEMU process. The worker verifies this value through QMP. |
| `machineType` | Explicitly versioned machine type, for example `pc-q35-6.2`. |
| `cpuModel` | Effective QEMU CPU model. `host` normally requires homogeneous restore nodes. |
| `vcpus` | Effective vCPU count. |
| `memoryBytes` | Effective Guest RAM size in bytes. |
| `qemuConfigDigest` | Workload-generated SHA-256 identity of compatibility-sensitive QEMU configuration. |
| `disks` | Writable overlays and their capture policy. v1 supports only `capture: rootfs`. |

`qemuConfigDigest` is an opaque compatibility value in v1. Compute it
deterministically from a canonical representation of machine, CPU, memory,
firmware, disk, network, and device settings. Exclude transient values such as
PID, timestamps, QMP paths, and generated socket names. OpenSandbox records the
digest but does not reconstruct the QEMU command line from it.

Write the manifest atomically so a concurrent snapshot cannot read a partial
JSON file:

```bash
runtime_dir=/run/qemu
manifest_tmp="$runtime_dir/launch.json.tmp"
manifest="$runtime_dir/launch.json"

mkdir -p "$runtime_dir"
cat >"$manifest_tmp" <<EOF
{
  "formatVersion": "qemu-v1",
  "architecture": "amd64",
  "qemuVersion": "$qemu_version",
  "machineType": "$machine_type",
  "cpuModel": "$cpu_model",
  "vcpus": $vcpus,
  "memoryBytes": $memory_bytes,
  "qemuConfigDigest": "$qemu_config_digest",
  "disks": [
    {"id":"osdisk","overlayPath":"/vm/state.qcow2","capture":"rootfs"}
  ]
}
EOF
mv "$manifest_tmp" "$manifest"
```

The reference E2E entrypoint shows the manifest and QEMU arguments being built
from one set of variables. See the
[reference entrypoint](https://github.com/alibaba/OpenSandbox/blob/main/kubernetes/test/e2e_qemu/testdata/entrypoint.sh).

### Expose QMP and support restore

Create the declared QMP Unix socket when QEMU starts:

```bash
qemu_args+=(
  -qmp "unix:/run/qemu/qmp.sock,server=on,wait=off"
)
```

QMP controls the live QEMU process and transports the migration stream. The
launch manifest separately declares compatibility and disk-capture intent that
cannot be recovered reliably from QMP alone.

The workload entrypoint must detect `OPENSANDBOX_RESTORE_MODE=qemu-v1` and
start QEMU with the loader stream supplied in `OPENSANDBOX_VMSTATE_DIR`:

```bash
if [[ "${OPENSANDBOX_RESTORE_MODE:-}" == "qemu-v1" ]]; then
  test -x "$OPENSANDBOX_VMSTATE_DIR/vmstate-loader"
  qemu_args+=(
    -incoming
    "exec:$OPENSANDBOX_VMSTATE_DIR/vmstate-loader stream --dir $OPENSANDBOX_VMSTATE_DIR"
  )
fi
```

OpenSandbox injects the restore directory and loader; the workload still owns
the complete QEMU command line. It must recreate the same machine, CPU, memory,
firmware, disks, network, and device topology before consuming the incoming
stream.

### Keep the writable overlay in the rootfs

Every disk declared with `capture: rootfs` must be a file in the QEMU
container's writable rootfs. It must not resolve under a Kubernetes
`volumeMount` or `volumeDevice`, including PVC, hostPath, projected volume, or
`emptyDir`. `nerdctl commit` does not capture those mounts, and the snapshot
worker rejects the configuration instead of creating an incomplete snapshot.

An immutable base image can come from the original image layer or another
independently available read-only source. Existing user init containers run
again before the injected VMState loader on resume, so they must be idempotent
and must not overwrite the restored writable overlay.

## Pause and resume sequence

1. The controller resolves the annotated QEMU container and schedules the snapshot Job on the same node.
2. The worker validates that every writable overlay declared as `capture: rootfs` is outside the container's Kubernetes volume mount paths.
3. The worker uses QMP migration to export VM state, compresses it with zstd, and puts it into a standard container image.
4. After QEMU reaches post-migration state, the worker freezes the outer containers, commits their root filesystems, and pushes both image types.
5. The controller publishes rootfs and VMState manifest digests atomically, then removes the source Pod.
6. On resume, a loader init container restores and verifies the VMState files in an `emptyDir`. It is appended after all user init containers.
7. The recreated QEMU container consumes the migration stream. Other outer-container processes start normally from the Pod template.

`savevm` is not used. It creates an internal snapshot coupled to qcow2 storage and is not the transport for live Guest RAM used here.

## Production deployment with Helm

There is no QEMU-specific Helm feature switch. Helm installs the cluster-level
snapshot capability; each `BatchSandbox` or `Pool` Pod template opts in through
the annotations above. Rootfs-only workloads continue to use the existing
behavior.

### Prerequisites

- Linux nodes with `/dev/kvm` exposed to the QEMU container.
- The image Registry must accept Docker schema 2 or OCI image manifests and be reachable from both snapshot Jobs and kubelet/containerd.
- The QEMU version, versioned machine type, CPU model, vCPU count, RAM size, device configuration digest, and optional node class must match on restore.
- The snapshot Job needs the host containerd runtime directory, host PID namespace, and `SYS_PTRACE`. It already operates inside the node-level trust boundary because it controls the containerd socket. Pod Security and admission policies must explicitly allow this Job.
- VMState can contain credentials and user data from Guest RAM. Apply the same access control, encryption, retention, and deletion policy as sensitive persistent storage.
- Plan Registry capacity from measured compressed payload size. Compression depends on Guest memory contents; it is not guaranteed to be small.

The controller image and image-committer image must both come from a version
that supports `qemu-v1`. In particular, do not rely on an older chart default
for `controller.snapshot.imageCommitterImage`; override it explicitly.

### Create Registry credentials

The commit Job and resumed Pod run in the sandbox namespace, so the referenced
Secrets must exist in every namespace that uses snapshot and restore:

```bash
kubectl -n sandbox-team create secret docker-registry snapshot-registry \
  --docker-server=registry.example.com \
  --docker-username='<username>' \
  --docker-password='<password-or-token>'
```

One Secret can be used for push, image-committer pull, and resume pull when the
credential has all three permissions. Production deployments may use separate
least-privilege Secrets with the same names in each sandbox namespace.

### Configure and install the chart

Create a values file:

```yaml
controller:
  image:
    repository: registry.example.com/opensandbox/controller
    tag: qemu-v1
  snapshot:
    imageCommitterImage: registry.example.com/opensandbox/image-committer:qemu-v1
    containerdSocketPath: /var/run/containerd/containerd.sock
    commitJobTimeout: 15m
    registry: registry.example.com/opensandbox-snapshots
    registryInsecure: false
    snapshotPushSecret: snapshot-registry
    imageCommitterPullSecret: snapshot-registry
    resumePullSecret: snapshot-registry
```

Install or upgrade the controller. On a fresh cluster, install the base chart
first — the controller chart no longer ships the CRDs:

```bash
helm upgrade --install base ./manifests/charts/base

helm upgrade --install opensandbox-controller \
  ./manifests/charts/controller \
  --namespace opensandbox-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --values qemu-snapshot-values.yaml
```

Sync the CRDs into the base chart (`make -C manifests helm-gen-crds`) and
upgrade `base` so the updated `SandboxSnapshot` CRD lands. Verify the deployed
capability before creating workloads:

```bash
kubectl -n opensandbox-system rollout status \
  deployment/opensandbox-controller-manager
kubectl -n opensandbox-system get deployment,pod
kubectl get crd sandboxsnapshots.sandbox.opensandbox.io
kubectl get crd sandboxsnapshots.sandbox.opensandbox.io \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.versions[0].schema.openAPIV3Schema.properties.status.properties.virtualMachine.type}{"\n"}'
```

Confirm that cluster admission permits the node-trusted snapshot Job. QEMU
mode requires the host PID namespace, `SYS_PTRACE`, and the host containerd
runtime directory. The QEMU workload itself needs `/dev/kvm` and normally runs
privileged unless the platform supplies narrower device permissions.

For heterogeneous fleets, label compatible restore nodes and declare the
matching class on the workload:

```bash
kubectl label node <node> \
  sandbox.opensandbox.io/qemu-node-class=shenlong-v1
```

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    sandbox.opensandbox.io/qemu-required-node-class: shenlong-v1
```

Snapshot image names are generated below the configured Registry prefix. A
QEMU sandbox produces normal container rootfs images such as
`<prefix>/<sandbox>-<container>:<tag>` and a VMState image such as
`<prefix>/<sandbox>-vmstate:<tag>`. Resume resolves and uses their immutable
manifest digests.

## Validation

The dedicated E2E allocates a warm QEMU-in-runc Pod from a `Pool`, writes independent values into an anonymous mmap, the raw Guest disk, and the outer rootfs, snapshots both images, and restores a standalone Pod. It verifies Pool replenishment and detachment, immutable rootfs and VMState image digests, loader completion, snapshot cleanup, all three values, the Guest boot ID, and the live counter:

```bash
cd kubernetes
make test-e2e-qemu
```

The test requires Linux amd64, Docker, Kind, kubectl, and `/dev/kvm`. By default it deploys an isolated `registry:2` Pod in the Kind cluster. Set `QEMU_E2E_SNAPSHOT_REGISTRY` and `QEMU_E2E_DOCKER_CONFIG` to verify the same flow against an authenticated external Registry; the two repositories are `<prefix>/qemu-rootfs` and `<prefix>/qemu-vmstate`. Set `KEEP_QEMU_E2E_CLUSTER=true` to retain the dedicated Kind cluster for diagnostics. See the [E2E README](https://github.com/alibaba/OpenSandbox/tree/main/kubernetes/test/e2e_qemu) for all overrides.

### Reusable Kind validation environment

The E2E harness can build the images, create a dedicated KVM-enabled Kind
cluster, deploy the controller and Registry, run the reference Pool flow, and
leave the environment available for manual checks:

```bash
cd kubernetes
KEEP_QEMU_E2E_CLUSTER=true make test-e2e-qemu
```

The resulting context is `kind-opensandbox-qemu-vmstate-e2e`. The controller
runs in `opensandbox-system`, while the in-cluster `registry:2` Pod and the
automated test objects run in `qemu-vmstate-e2e`:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-opensandbox-qemu-vmstate-e2e \
  -n opensandbox-system get deploy,pod
kubectl --context kind-opensandbox-qemu-vmstate-e2e \
  -n qemu-vmstate-e2e get pod,service,pool,batchsandbox
```

To exercise an authenticated external Registry instead, provide its repository
prefix and a local Docker `config.json`; the harness creates the temporary
Kubernetes pull/push Secret without printing its contents:

```bash
QEMU_E2E_SNAPSHOT_REGISTRY=registry.example.com/team \
QEMU_E2E_DOCKER_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json \
KEEP_QEMU_E2E_CLUSTER=true \
make test-e2e-qemu
```

The commands below use a separate `qemu-manual` namespace, so the retained E2E
objects do not need to be deleted first.

### Manual validation in a prepared Kind cluster

This flow deliberately leaves lifecycle actions to the operator. It assumes
the controller, snapshot Registry, image-committer image, and demo QEMU image
are already installed in a Kind cluster with `/dev/kvm`. From the repository
root, select that cluster and create only the standalone `BatchSandbox`:

```bash
export OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT=kind-opensandbox-qemu-vmstate-e2e
export OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE=qemu-manual
export OSB_QEMU_SANDBOX=qemu-standalone
export OSB_QEMU_POD=qemu-standalone-0

test -c /dev/kvm
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" get nodes
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n opensandbox-system \
  rollout status deployment/opensandbox-controller-manager
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" apply \
  -f kubernetes/config/samples/alibaba/qemu-vmstate/standalone.yaml
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  wait --for=condition=Ready pod/"$OSB_QEMU_POD" --timeout=180s
```

Before pausing, verify the exact contract that the snapshot worker will use:

```bash
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  get pod "$OSB_QEMU_POD" \
  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations}{"\n"}'
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -c qemu -- \
  test -S /run/qemu-e2e/qmp.sock
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -c qemu -- \
  cat /run/qemu-e2e/launch.json
```

Do not continue if the annotated container, socket path, manifest path, or
effective QEMU settings disagree.

The demo Guest runs the HTTP server and the mutable memory map in the same PID
1 process. QEMU user networking forwards the outer container's loopback port
`18080` to Guest port `8080`; the service is not exposed on the Pod IP.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /healthz` | Verify that the resumed Guest process is serving requests |
| `PUT /value` | Store a value of up to 512 bytes in the process memory map |
| `GET /value` | Read the current memory-map value |
| `GET /status` | Read PID, Guest boot ID, mmap-backed live counter, and value |
| `PUT /disk` | Store a marker in the raw writable Guest disk |
| `GET /disk` | Read the raw Guest disk marker |

Define a phase waiter and put three independent markers in Guest memory, the
Guest disk, and the outer container rootfs:

```bash
wait_for_sandbox_phase() {
  local wanted=$1
  local phase=
  for _ in $(seq 1 180); do
    phase=$(kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" \
      -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" get batchsandbox "$OSB_QEMU_SANDBOX" \
      -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}' 2>/dev/null || true)
    if [[ "$phase" == "$wanted" ]]; then
      return 0
    fi
    sleep 2
  done
  echo "timed out waiting for phase=$wanted; last phase=$phase" >&2
  return 1
}

export OSB_MEMORY_TOKEN="MANUAL-MMAP-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
export OSB_DISK_TOKEN="MANUAL-DISK-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
export OSB_ROOTFS_TOKEN="MANUAL-ROOTFS-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"

kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -c qemu -- \
  curl --fail --silent --show-error --request PUT \
  --data-binary "$OSB_MEMORY_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:18080/value
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -c qemu -- \
  curl --fail --silent --show-error --request PUT \
  --data-binary "$OSB_DISK_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:18080/disk
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -c qemu -- sh -c \
  'mkdir -p /var/lib/opensandbox && printf "%s" "$1" > /var/lib/opensandbox/rootfs-marker' \
  sh "$OSB_ROOTFS_TOKEN"

OSB_BEFORE=$(kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -c qemu -- \
  curl --fail --silent --show-error http://127.0.0.1:18080/status)
OSB_SOURCE_UID=$(kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  get pod "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}')
printf 'before: %s\nsource uid: %s\n' "$OSB_BEFORE" "$OSB_SOURCE_UID"
```

In another terminal, watch the resources involved in pause and resume:

```bash
watch -n 1 kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" \
  -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" get batchsandbox,sandboxsnapshot,pod,job
```

The initial manifest intentionally omits `spec.pause`: setting it to `false`
on a brand-new object is interpreted as an explicit resume request. Pause the
sandbox by adding `spec.pause: true`, then inspect the two immutable image
artifacts:

```bash
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  edit batchsandbox "$OSB_QEMU_SANDBOX"
wait_for_sandbox_phase Paused

export OSB_SNAPSHOT_NAME="$OSB_QEMU_SANDBOX-pause"
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  get sandboxsnapshot "$OSB_SNAPSHOT_NAME" -o yaml
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  wait --for=delete pod/"$OSB_QEMU_POD" --timeout=120s
```

The snapshot must report `status.format: qemu-v1`, a rootfs image digest under
`status.containers`, and a different VMState image digest plus a non-zero
compressed size under `status.virtualMachine`.

Resume by editing `spec.pause` to `false`, then verify process-level
continuity and both filesystem layers:

```bash
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  edit batchsandbox "$OSB_QEMU_SANDBOX"
wait_for_sandbox_phase Succeed
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  wait --for=condition=Ready pod/"$OSB_QEMU_POD" --timeout=180s

OSB_AFTER=$(kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -c qemu -- \
  curl --fail --silent --show-error http://127.0.0.1:18080/status)
OSB_AFTER_DISK=$(kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -c qemu -- \
  curl --fail --silent --show-error http://127.0.0.1:18080/disk)
OSB_AFTER_ROOTFS=$(kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -c qemu -- cat /var/lib/opensandbox/rootfs-marker)
OSB_RESTORED_UID=$(kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  get pod "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}')

OSB_BEFORE_BOOT_ID=$(printf '%s\n' "$OSB_BEFORE" | sed -n 's/.*"boot_id":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
OSB_AFTER_BOOT_ID=$(printf '%s\n' "$OSB_AFTER" | sed -n 's/.*"boot_id":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
OSB_BEFORE_COUNTER=$(printf '%s\n' "$OSB_BEFORE" | sed -n 's/.*"counter":\([0-9]*\).*/\1/p')
OSB_AFTER_COUNTER=$(printf '%s\n' "$OSB_AFTER" | sed -n 's/.*"counter":\([0-9]*\).*/\1/p')

[[ "$OSB_SOURCE_UID" != "$OSB_RESTORED_UID" ]]
[[ "$OSB_BEFORE_BOOT_ID" == "$OSB_AFTER_BOOT_ID" ]]
((OSB_AFTER_COUNTER > OSB_BEFORE_COUNTER))
[[ "$OSB_AFTER" == *"\"value\":\"$OSB_MEMORY_TOKEN\""* ]]
[[ "$OSB_AFTER_DISK" == *"\"value\":\"$OSB_DISK_TOKEN\""* ]]
[[ "$OSB_AFTER_ROOTFS" == "$OSB_ROOTFS_TOKEN" ]]

printf 'after: %s\ndisk: %s\nrootfs: %s\nrestored uid: %s\n' \
  "$OSB_AFTER" "$OSB_AFTER_DISK" "$OSB_AFTER_ROOTFS" "$OSB_RESTORED_UID"
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  get pod "$OSB_QEMU_POD" -o jsonpath='{range .status.initContainerStatuses[*]}{.name}{"="}{.state.terminated.reason}{"\n"}{end}'
```

All assertions must return zero. The Pod UID must change, the Guest boot ID
must remain the same, the live counter must increase, all three tokens must
match, and the VMState loader init container must report `Completed`. The
internal `SandboxSnapshot` is deleted after a successful resume. Remove only
the test object when finished; the Kind infrastructure remains available:

```bash
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" delete \
  -f kubernetes/config/samples/alibaba/qemu-vmstate/standalone.yaml
```

### Manual validation with a Pool

Create the Pool first and wait for its warm QEMU Pod. Then create a
`BatchSandbox` that allocates that Pod:

```bash
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" apply \
  -f kubernetes/config/samples/alibaba/qemu-vmstate/pool.yaml
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  get pool qemu-pool -w
```

After the Pool reports ready capacity, stop the watch and run:

```bash
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" apply \
  -f kubernetes/config/samples/alibaba/qemu-vmstate/pooled-sandbox.yaml
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  get batchsandbox qemu-pooled -w
```

Read the allocated Pod name from the allocation annotation and write the same
three markers used by the standalone case:

```bash
export OSB_POOLED_POD=$(kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" \
  -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" get batchsandbox qemu-pooled \
  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.sandbox\.opensandbox\.io/alloc-status}' \
  | jq -r '.pods[0]')

export OSB_POOL_MEMORY_TOKEN="POOL-MMAP-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
export OSB_POOL_DISK_TOKEN="POOL-DISK-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
export OSB_POOL_ROOTFS_TOKEN="POOL-ROOTFS-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"

kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_POOLED_POD" -c qemu -- \
  curl --fail --silent --show-error --request PUT \
  --data-binary "$OSB_POOL_MEMORY_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:18080/value
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_POOLED_POD" -c qemu -- \
  curl --fail --silent --show-error --request PUT \
  --data-binary "$OSB_POOL_DISK_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:18080/disk
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  exec "$OSB_POOLED_POD" -c qemu -- sh -c \
  'mkdir -p /var/lib/opensandbox && printf "%s" "$1" > /var/lib/opensandbox/rootfs-marker' \
  sh "$OSB_POOL_ROOTFS_TOKEN"
```

Run `kubectl edit batchsandbox qemu-pooled -n qemu-manual` and add
`spec.pause: true`. On successful pause, verify the Pool-specific handoff:

```bash
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  get batchsandbox qemu-pooled \
  -o jsonpath='phase={.status.phase}{" poolRef="}{.spec.poolRef}{" templateContainers="}{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].name}{"\n"}'
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" -n "$OSB_QEMU_NAMESPACE" \
  get sandboxsnapshot qemu-pooled-pause -o yaml
```

The phase must be `Paused`. The controller materializes the allocated Pod's
template into the `BatchSandbox` and clears `spec.poolRef`; this detach is
intentional, so resume creates an independent Pod instead of returning to the
Pool. Edit `spec.pause` back to `false`, wait for `qemu-pooled-0` to become
Ready, then call `GET /status`, `GET /disk`, and the rootfs marker check against
it.

Clean up the Pool example without deleting the Kind cluster:

```bash
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" delete \
  -f kubernetes/config/samples/alibaba/qemu-vmstate/pooled-sandbox.yaml
kubectl --context "$OSB_QEMU_CONTEXT" delete \
  -f kubernetes/config/samples/alibaba/qemu-vmstate/pool.yaml
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| `InvalidCheckpointContract` | Confirm all four required annotations are on the actual Pod template and name an existing container. Paths must be clean and absolute. |
| Launch manifest copy or decode failure | Exec into the annotated container, read the exact path, and verify that the entrypoint writes complete JSON before readiness succeeds. |
| QMP probe failure | Verify that the declared path is a Unix socket and that QEMU uses `server=on,wait=off`. Check whether a supervisor removed or replaced the socket. |
| QEMU version mismatch | Compare `qemuVersion` in the manifest with the running binary. Generate the manifest at container startup instead of baking a stale version into the image. |
| Writable disk rejected | Check every `volumeMount` and `volumeDevice` on the QEMU container. A `capture: rootfs` overlay cannot live below any mounted path. |
| Snapshot Job rejected by admission | Permit the image-committer Job identity to use host PID, `SYS_PTRACE`, and the host containerd runtime directory on snapshot-capable nodes. |
| Snapshot Job `ImagePullBackOff` | Ensure `imageCommitterPullSecret` exists in the sandbox namespace and can pull the configured image-committer image. |
| Resumed Pod `ImagePullBackOff` | Ensure `resumePullSecret` exists in the sandbox namespace and can pull both rootfs and VMState image repositories. |
| QEMU exits while consuming `-incoming` | Compare QEMU version, machine type, CPU model, vCPU count, memory, firmware, disks, network, and device topology with the captured compatibility data. |
| Pod cannot schedule after resume | Check `/dev/kvm`, node affinity, and `qemu-required-node-class` against the node's `qemu-node-class` label. |

Start diagnosis from the snapshot status and commit Job logs:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> get sandboxsnapshot <name> -o yaml
kubectl -n <namespace> get job,pod \
  -l sandbox.opensandbox.io/sandbox-snapshot-name=<name>
kubectl -n <namespace> logs job/<commit-job-name> --all-containers
```
