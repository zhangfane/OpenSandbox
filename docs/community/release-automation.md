# Release Automation

This repository uses tag-driven publish workflows. The script below standardizes:

- canonical tag creation for each release target
- release note generation from previous release to current commit
- GitHub Release create/update
- signed source archive upload and provenance attestation in the Generic
  Release workflow

Script path:

- `manifests/release/create-release.sh`

## Supported Targets

- `js/sandbox`
- `js/code-interpreter`
- `python/sandbox`
- `python/code-interpreter`
- `python/mcp/sandbox`
- `java/sandbox`
- `csharp/sandbox`
- `csharp/code-interpreter`
- `sdks/sandbox/go`
- `cli`
- `server`
- `docker/execd`
- `docker/nodeagent`
- `docker/ingress`
- `docker/egress`
- `k8s/controller`
- `k8s/task-executor`
- `helm/opensandbox`
- `helm/opensandbox-node-agent`
- `helm` (alias of `helm/opensandbox`)

The `opensandbox/code-interpreter` sandbox container image is published and versioned independently from its dedicated repository: [opensandbox-group/sandbox-images](https://github.com/opensandbox-group/sandbox-images).

The `java/sandbox` target publishes the Kotlin/JVM SDK release train, including
`sandbox`, `sandbox-api`, `sandbox-pool-redis`, `code-interpreter`, and
`sandbox-bom`.

## Tag Rules

The script aligns with existing workflow triggers:

- v-prefixed tags:
  - `<target>/v<version>` for SDK/CLI/Server targets
  - examples: `js/sandbox/v1.0.5`, `server/v0.2.0`
  - Go SDK example: `sdks/sandbox/go/v1.0.0`
- plain suffix tags:
  - `<target>/<version>` for docker/k8s/helm targets
  - examples: `docker/execd/v0.3.0`, `helm/opensandbox/0.1.0`

Release tag namespaces are protected by repository rulesets. Only authorized
release managers may create matching tags, and an existing release tag cannot
be updated or deleted.

## Release Approval and Source Verification

Hosted publish workflows run a shared release preflight before publishing:

- the release commit must be reachable from `origin/main`
- non-dry-run releases require approval through the `release` environment
- the person who triggered the release cannot approve their own deployment

This implements two-person control: one person initiates the release and a
different Project Maintainer approves it. GitHub environments require one of
the configured reviewers; they do not natively support requiring two reviewer
approvals in addition to the initiator.

The hosted Generic Release workflow does not create or push release tags. An
authorized release manager must create the tag from a commit on `main` before
running a non-dry-run Generic Release.

## Release Notes Format

Generated notes follow this section structure:

- `## What's New`
- `### ✨ Features`
- `### 🐛 Bug Fixes`
- `### ⚠️ Breaking Changes`
- `### 📦 Misc`
- `## 👥 Contributors`

Commit categorization:

- `feat:` -> Features
- `fix:` -> Bug Fixes
- `BREAKING CHANGE` or `type!:` -> Breaking Changes
- everything else -> Misc

## Usage

```bash
manifests/release/create-release.sh --target <target> --version <version> [options]
```

Required:

- `--target`
- `--version`

Options:

- `--from-tag <tag>`: explicit previous release boundary
- `--path <path>`: append custom path filter (repeatable)
- `--no-path-filter`: disable default target path scope and use whole range
- `--initial-release`: allow no previous tag; use full history
- `--dry-run`: render computed tag/range/notes without side effects
- `--push`: push created tag to origin
- `--sign-tag`: create a cryptographically signed git tag using the local git
  signing configuration. This is intended for local release-operator use, not
  the hosted GitHub Actions release workflow.

## Path Filtering Strategy

By default, each target only includes commits from target-related paths to reduce noise.

Examples:

- `js/sandbox` -> `sdks/sandbox/javascript` + `specs/sandbox-lifecycle.yml`
- `server` -> `server` + `specs/sandbox-lifecycle.yml`
- `docker/egress` -> `components/egress`
- `docker/nodeagent` -> `components/nodeagent` + `components/internal`
- `helm/opensandbox` -> `manifests/charts/opensandbox`
- `helm/opensandbox-node-agent` -> `manifests/charts/node-agent`

Override behavior:

- Add extra scope with `--path`:
  - `--path docs/` or `--path specs/execd-api.yaml`
- Disable default scope with `--no-path-filter`:
  - falls back to the entire commit range (`from..HEAD`)

## Common Examples

Dry-run JavaScript SDK release:

```bash
manifests/release/create-release.sh --target js/sandbox --version 1.0.5 --dry-run
```

Dry-run server release:

```bash
manifests/release/create-release.sh --target server --version 0.2.0 --dry-run
```

Dry-run JavaScript SDK release with additional docs scope:

```bash
manifests/release/create-release.sh --target js/sandbox --version 1.0.5 --dry-run --path docs/
```

Dry-run JavaScript SDK release without path filtering (full range):

```bash
manifests/release/create-release.sh --target js/sandbox --version 1.0.5 --dry-run --no-path-filter
```

Server release with tag push:

```bash
manifests/release/create-release.sh --target server --version 0.2.0 --push
```

Component image release:

```bash
manifests/release/create-release.sh --target docker/execd --version v0.3.0 --push
```

Helm chart release:

```bash
manifests/release/create-release.sh --target helm/opensandbox --version 0.1.0 --push
```

## Dry-Run Output Example

Example output format for `--dry-run`:

```text
[release] Target: js/sandbox
[release] Workflow: .github/workflows/publish-js-sdks.yml
[release] New tag: js/sandbox/v1.0.5
[release] Previous tag: js/sandbox/v0.1.4
[release] Path filters: sdks/sandbox/javascript specs/sandbox-lifecycle.yml
[release] Dry run enabled. No tag/release side effects will be performed.
[release] Computed range: js/sandbox/v0.1.4..HEAD

[release] Generated release notes preview:
------------------------------------------------------------
# JavaScript Sandbox SDK v1.0.5
## What's New
Changes included since `js/sandbox/v0.1.4`.
Scoped paths: `sdks/sandbox/javascript specs/sandbox-lifecycle.yml`.

### ✨ Features
- feat(sdks/js): support run_in_session

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- fix(lifecycle): harden sdk compatibility and e2e stability

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- None

### 📦 Misc
- chore(sdks): rebuild source code
------------------------------------------------------------
```

If `--dry-run` is enabled, the script never creates/pushes tags and never creates/updates GitHub Releases.

## Safety Defaults

- The script creates/updates GitHub Release only when not in `--dry-run`.
- Tag push is opt-in (`--push`), preventing accidental workflow trigger.
- Tag signing is opt-in (`--sign-tag`) because it requires release-operator git
  signing keys. The hosted GitHub Actions release workflow does not expose this
  option. Official release artifacts are still signed by the GitHub release
  workflows through Sigstore/GitHub attestations.
- If previous tag cannot be found, script fails unless `--from-tag` or `--initial-release` is provided.

## GitHub Actions Entry

The GitHub Actions dispatch entry for this flow (`release-generic.yml`) was
removed because it had no callers; the release process uses tag pushes that
trigger the `publish-*` workflows directly. Run `manifests/release/create-release.sh`
locally to create release tags and GitHub Releases:

When `dry_run=false`, `manifests/release/create-release.sh` creates the tag and
the GitHub Release. Source archives (`opensandbox-<tag>.tar.gz` + `SHA256SUMS`)
were previously uploaded by the removed `release-generic.yml` workflow; releases
created after its removal no longer carry source archives. See
[Release Verification](release-verification.md) for user verification commands
and release signing coverage.
