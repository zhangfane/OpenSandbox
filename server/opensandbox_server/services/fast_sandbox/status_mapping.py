"""Map FastPath runtime observations to OpenSandbox lifecycle status.

fast-sandbox splits RuntimeReady (runtime up) from DataPlaneReady (routes and
Infra Components published). OpenSandbox reports Running only when both are
Ready, matching the "endpoint usable" expectation.

On expiry the reconciler keeps the Sandbox CRD with runtimeState=Stopped; that
retained object maps to Terminated.
