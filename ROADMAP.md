# OpenSandbox Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-04-28

This roadmap describes the intended project direction for roughly the next 12
months. It is a planning guide, not a release commitment. Implementation details
are tracked through GitHub Issues, pull requests, and OpenSandbox Enhancement
Proposals (OSEPs).

## Principles

- Keep public API contracts, SDKs, CLI behavior, implementation, examples, and
  documentation aligned.
- Prefer additive, backward-compatible changes for public interfaces.
- Use the OSEP process for major architecture, API, runtime, or security-model
  changes.
- Keep roadmap items focused on project direction instead of using this file as
  a full backlog.
- Move completed work into release notes, OSEP status, or stable documentation
  instead of keeping long historical task lists here.

## Current Focus: 2026 H1-H2

### Sandbox Runtime

| Area | Status | Tracking | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Local lightweight sandbox | Planned | TBD | Lightweight sandbox runtime for AI tools running directly on PCs. |
| Persistent volumes | Implementing | [OSEP-0003](oseps/0003-volume-and-volumebinding-support.md) | Close remaining runtime/backend gaps from OSEP-0003 before treating volume support as mature. |
| Secure container runtime | Implemented / maturing | [OSEP-0004](oseps/0004-secure-container-runtime.md), [secure container guide](docs/guides/secure-container.md) | Continue hardening isolation guidance and deployment practices. |
| Pause and resume via rootfs snapshot | Implementing | [OSEP-0008](oseps/0008-pause-resume-rootfs-snapshot.md) | Improve lifecycle support for stateful sandbox workflows. |
| Secure endpoint access | Implemented / maturing | [OSEP-0011](oseps/0011-secure-access-endpoint.md) | Keep endpoint security behavior aligned across server, SDKs, and docs. |

### SDKs and Developer Experience

| Area | Status | Tracking | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| SDK parity | Ongoing | [sdks/](sdks/), [specs/](specs/README.md) | Keep Python, Go, Kotlin, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C# SDKs aligned with public specs. |
| Client-side sandbox pool | Implemented / maturing | [OSEP-0005](oseps/0005-client-side-sandbox-pool.md) | Expand behavior consistency, tests, and documentation where practical. |
| CLI usability | Planned | [cli/](cli/README.md) | Improve common sandbox lifecycle workflows and developer ergonomics. |
| Developer console | Implementable | [OSEP-0006](oseps/0006-developer-console.md) | Provide a clearer operational surface for sandbox users and maintainers. |

### Observability and Operations

| Area | Status | Tracking | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| OpenTelemetry metrics and logs | Implementing | [OSEP-0010](oseps/0010-opentelemetry-instrumentation.md) | Add observability across execd, ingress, and egress. |
| Agent in-sandbox audit trail | Planned | TBD / OSEP needed | Define auditable records for agent actions inside sandboxes, such as command/session execution, file operations, network access, identity context, retention, and privacy boundaries. |
| Kubernetes deployment | Ongoing | [kubernetes/](kubernetes/README.md), [Helm charts](manifests/charts/) | Keep self-hosted deployment, chart, and operational documentation current. |
| Network isolation guidance | Ongoing | [network isolation guide](docs/architecture/network-isolation.md) | Continue documenting safe defaults and practical isolation patterns. |

### Public Contracts and Governance

| Area | Status | Tracking | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Lifecycle API stability | Ongoing | [specs/](specs/README.md), [OSEPs](oseps/README.md) | Preserve compatibility and require clear migration paths for user-visible changes. |
| Security documentation | Ongoing | [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), [docs/](docs/) | Keep vulnerability reporting, security expectations, and deployment guidance current. |
| Open project governance | Ongoing | [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Maintain a lightweight, public decision process as the project grows. |

## Not Currently Planned

- Declaring a stable v1 API before lifecycle semantics, runtime behavior, and
  SDK compatibility are mature enough to support it.
- Breaking public specs, SDK interfaces, CLI behavior, or documented workflows
  without an OSEP and migration path.
- Provider-specific features that cannot be documented, tested, or isolated
  cleanly from the public API surface.
- Heavy release-train governance before the project has enough maintainer
  capacity to keep that process current.

## How Roadmap Items Are Managed

- Small work is tracked as GitHub Issues and pull requests.
- Major features, architecture changes, public API changes, runtime behavior
  changes, and security-model changes start with an OSEP.
- Active roadmap entries should link to an issue, PR, OSEP, or documentation
  page once a stable tracking location exists.
- Completed work should be reflected in release notes, implemented OSEPs, and
  user documentation rather than remaining as an active roadmap item.
- Maintainers should review this file at least quarterly, or whenever a major
  OSEP changes status.
